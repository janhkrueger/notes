Currently it's hard to imaging that I will start DOW3 again in the near or even middle future. 

 

The game is on the tech side on a very high quality. It's a bit like the Avatar movie. James Cameron did a great job, good screenplay, high end tech with the new cameras etc... but after 15 minutes you can tell the development of every character, who will die, who will be the bad, the ugly and the good. Just looking at the story it was one of the most boring, predictable movies in the last decade. (Ok, I could not forsee that they're trying a vulcan mind meld with the doctor and the great tree to save her.) 

It lacks soul. 

 

In the end I'm starting Dune (the one with Sting!), Alien (1979 ) or the original Blade Runner movie to have some nice hours to relax in the evening after work. 

 

Same applies to DOW3. It's a great bunch of what we have seen before. No "wow" effects or really new mechanics to talk about which can be seen as game changer. 

Stripping the Warhammer 40K brand away and I don't think the game would really last more than the try outs on the greater audiance. 

The blink of a soul I could see in the "Dawn of War III â€“ Announcement Trailer" has not even touched the game. Currently it is for me a 08/15 RTS title which happens to have paid a big bunch of money to write Warhammer ontop of it. 

 

When we wanna have fun in the evening, our gang fires up the classics. AoE2, SC Remasterd, C&C2:RA or C&C:Generals, or even DOW 1:GOTY. (While SC2 can also be fun, the decision to always download stuff when you just wanna play a short match against the AI is not tolerable).
