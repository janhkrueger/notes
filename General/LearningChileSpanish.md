# Learning Chilean Spanish

I would suggest you look in YouTube for “Chilevision Pasapalabra”. An entertainment show focused on vocabulary where you can learn about different words and also hear Chileans talk.

Some Chilean channels you can look in youtube

    Canal 13 Chile

    TVN Chile

    CNN Chile

    Meganoticias Chile

    Chilevision

    La Red Chile

Mmm I recommend listen Patriarcalmente hablando in Spotify if you want to learn the “Chilean Spanish”. Btw, we have a loooot of words that means different things because of the context of where/when you said them.
