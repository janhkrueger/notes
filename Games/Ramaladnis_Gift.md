# Ramaladniâ€™s Gift

Ramaladniâ€™s Gift is quite rare, as itâ€™s sort of a bonus. A gift, if you will. ðŸ˜‰

It is not, however, limited to Greater Rifts. It can drop in any game mode.

    To further clarify, does Ramaladniâ€™s Gift drop only at Torment level or higher, or at all levels?
    Did some checking in to clarify a few points:
    * Ramaladniâ€™s Gift is considered a Torment Only item and begins dropping in Torment I.
    * It can drop from any source (monsters, chests, etc.) in any game mode.
    * It acts just like any other Torment-only Legendary and follows similar drop rules.

Hope that clears up some confusion. ðŸ™‚


Here's how Ramalandi's Gift is currently intended to work. This is all with the caveat that it's still under development, and potentially subject to change:

    * It will add a socket to an unsocketed weapon
    * It only works on weapons
    * It will work on enchanted weapons, so long as they don't have a socket
    * It effectively adds an item affix in the form of a socket
    * The added socket provided by Ramaladni's Gift cannot be enchanted.
    * You cannot use Ramaladni's on a weapon more than once.
    * Similarly, you cannot use Ramaladni's on a weapon that already has a socket.

You can, however:

    Replace a natural socket on a weapon with another primary stat (like VIT or STR or INT), and then use Ramaladni's after.
    Replace a re-rolled socket on a weapon with another primary stat (like VIT or STR or INT), and then use Ramaladni's Gift after.
    Enchant a weapon after a socket has been added using Ramaladni's Gift. You just won't be able to re-roll another socket on that particular weapon.

I realize the above may be somewhat confusing, so please let me know if you have any additional questions about this item's functionality.
