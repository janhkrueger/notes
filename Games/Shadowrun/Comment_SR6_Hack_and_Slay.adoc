# Comment on SR6 Hack and Slay


Despite several warnings, I decided to buy this book. Mostly because I was always a fan of the matrix und the main driver for my own characters, essentially the reason why I started with SR in edition 1.

After reading thru it, I can agree to some points already stated here or on other reviews. It delivers not so much really new, which is disappointing for a core rulebook. While also not including all past stuff from older publications. Till the present day, there is not a single place to look for previously published echos for example. I still need several books, even from different editions.

It reads as too much recycling of already published content with slight adjustments while also skipping previously published content.

Also, I'm not really sure that the current writers are having a real vision for the Matrix/Resonance and it gets further down the already started road. Getting Resonance and Matrix even more aligned with Magic, to the point where Resonance realms and metaplanes are getting connected.
This might be fine for some, I personally think it's getting to far and is oppisite to the original idea.

In retrospect, I believe one of the main points is coming from the drive to let the game time process with the real world, forcing the writers to think about how such technology could look like in the 2080th, ultimately failing with visions and just variations of the current content.

Especially in the chapters regarding technomancers (echos) and sprites. It is, for me, uncreative and washed up content or content ported from the magic book. Catalyst has lost the narrative on the matrix entirely and is reforming it to a second hand magic world. 

While for the magic world one can nearly freely invent and make up stuff, for technology this is not really working fully out. And after reading this book, one can feel the missing ideas.

I agree Rion S and his writings, sometimes it is not really clear what the writers wanted to tell or expect full knowledge of other publications. If I need to cross read a core rule book to understand it, that it is a bad product for me. A core rule book needs to be clear, understandably and with as possible no places for interpretation. Also for people who are not living all day in the SR books.

Editing and layout did not really hurt me, I can overlook this. If anything, the heavy use of graphics, background stuff, is blowing the file up (107MB) and just forces one to read on a tablet or computer. I would like to have a smaller, more streamlined, version. In the end, this is a digital product. (Hint: even on a kindle scribe with the bigger screen, the book dies not look good. First edition and second edition publications are way better). I'm buying it for the content, not for nice graphics. Then I would buy the paper version. 

For me, this was the last 6th edition book I bought, I don't see how Catalyst will get a turnaround for (in my opinion) good content regarding the P&P.
It feels more and more that the SR license should be handed towards someone other where content matters, not the visuals. And content should be high quality, not content to have content. The technonancer and resonance chapters are really hurting.

If it would be possible: throw the current approach away and let the matrix / resonance be their own thing and not try to integrate resonance into magic.
Or simply fire the people who think this was a good idea. It is not. It is bad writing without innovative ideas. it is recycling out off a lack of ideas. If there is noting new, just don't publish anything for the sake of publishing.

Therefore I can agree Rion S and also issue a buyers beware. Also I can agree Henry, the content is ... well.


With a small exception, when Pegasus Press is publishing an own book, German centered. They have to far, good writers where it is really fun reading.
