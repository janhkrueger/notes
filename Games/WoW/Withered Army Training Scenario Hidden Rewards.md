The Withered Army Training is a scenario where you lead withered into the Ruins of Falanaar in order to train your army, gain reputation with the Nightfallen and earn plenty of hidden rewards.

In this guide we'll go over how to get all of the hidden rewards from this scenario: the withered upgrades, the fox mount, bank access in Shal'Aran, many toys for the Toy Box, and more!

## How to unlock the Withered Army Training Scenario

You can unlock the access to this scenario by completing its introduction quest [Building an Army](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44636-building-an-army). Once unlocked, the World Quest [Withered Army Training](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/43943-withered-army-training) will appear every 3 days in Shal'Aran, giving you access to the scenario at the price of some Ancient Mana. The more mana you spend, the more withered you can start the scenario with. You can also find more withered while inside the scenario, and they will follow you until they die, flee, or get used to bring chests back to Thalyssra.

## Withered Army Training Rewards

Throughout the scenario you can find three types of chests: small, medium and large. Small chests can be opened right away, and they can be found multiple times, but medium and large chests will require some withered to carry them back to Thalyssra, and can only be opened after the training is over. Medium and large chests can also only be opened once, as they contain unique items and permanent upgrades for your withered army.

### Rewards Script

You can use the following Lua script with the [Arbitrary Commands](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/arbitcomm) addon to check which rewards you have collected from Medium and Large Chests.

Open the addon window, go to Player Scripts, create new script, and then paste and run the following script:

`for q,i in pairs({["Berserking Helm of Ondry'el"]=43071,   ["Spellmask of Alla'onus"]=43128,   ["Lenses of Spellseer Dellian"]=43134,   ["Disc of the Starcaller"]=43135,   ["Berserking Helm of Taenna"]=43145,   ["Spellmask of Azsylla"]=43146,   ["Leyline Broodling"]=43141,   ["Petrified Silkweave"]=43149,   ["Soothing Leystone Shard"]=43111,   ["Box of Calming Whispers"]=43120,   ["Lens of Qin'dera"]=43148,   ["Traveler's Banking Chest"]=43140,   ["Ancient Mana Basin"]=43144,   ["Manafused Fal'dorei Egg Sac"]=43142,   ["Treemender's Beacon"]=43143}) do   print(q, C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(i))   end`
