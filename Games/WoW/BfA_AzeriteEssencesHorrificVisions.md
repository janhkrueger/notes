# Azerite Essences from Horrific Visions
 Spark of Inspiration,  Unwavering Ward, and  Strength of the Warden are Azerite Essences obtained and upgraded from Horrific Visions.

Players will be able to obtain Rank 2 of this essence fairly quickly, you only need to clear a Hard Tier area to obtain it (which is not that hard on its own).

Rank 3 will take some time as at the absolute best, it takes 5 runs clearing all 5 objectives.
