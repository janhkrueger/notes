This guide documents all the Hidden Battle Pet Vendors in Battle for Azeroth, and such it acts as a reference hub for every Horde and Alliance Hidden Pet Vendor in Zandalar and Kul Tiras.

We have made a list of all hidden pet vendors, with the steps involved on how to unlock these vendors. In addition, once you have access to the vendors some battle pets might be hidden and not available for purchase. To unlock those pets you will have to complete quests, missions or achievements, which we have also detailed within this guide.
