## Secret Fish and Where to Find Them

To complete the achievement [Secret Fish and Where to Find Them](https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13502-secret-fish-and-where-to-find-them) you will have to use the [Secret Fish Goggles](https://www.wowdb.com/items/167698-secret-fish-goggles).

While you have the goggles on, a random fish will spawn within 40 yards of you every 30 seconds. Once you catch it there is a chance you will receive "a rare secret fish" that is required for the achievement.

### Common Fish

You can find the following fish in any zone. There's no need to focus on these fish as you'll probably have them all by the time you're done with the others.

-   [Travelling Goby](https://www.wowdb.com/items/167714-travelling-goby)
-   [Unseen Mimmic](https://www.wowdb.com/items/167716-unseen-mimmic)

**Tip:** The best place to farm these fish is on top of one of the floating rocks in Nagrand (Outland). Stay on one side of the floating rock as shown in the picture below and the fish will spawn on the opposite side.

If you have a friend with the [Secret Fish Goggles](https://www.wowdb.com/items/167698-secret-fish-goggles) then you can speed up the process and catch the fish without much effort or movement.
