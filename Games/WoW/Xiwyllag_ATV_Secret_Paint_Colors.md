# Xiwyllag ATV

Xiwyllag ATV is a new customizable mount added in Patch 8.2 Rise of Azshara. Similar to the X-995 Mechanocat, you can unlock paint colors for it by completing different activities on the Mechagon Island.

Since [Xiwyllag ATV](https://www.wowdb.com/items/153594-xiwyllag-atv)'s paint colors are untrackable, unlike [X-995 Mechanocat](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/294143-x-995-mechanocat)'s paint colors in the achievement [Available in Eight Colors](https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13513-available-in-eight-colors), we consider them secret collectibles and therefore we have added them in our [Secrets Database](https://warcraft-secrets.com/secrets).
