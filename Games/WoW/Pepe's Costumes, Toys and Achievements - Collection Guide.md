Pepe is one of the most beloved and faithful companions in World of Warcraft. Added in Warlords of Draenor, he quickly took over our hearts and became a little celebrity. Nowadays, rarely anyone chooses to venture into new content alone, and with [Pepe](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/181943-pepe), you've got a friend with you all the time!

For both Horde and Alliance players, Pepe can be found in the first tree on the left after exiting the main building in the Level 3 Garrison. When interacting with him, you will get a 1 hour buff that reads "You've got a friend!" which is adorable on its own. Pepe will sit on your head for that duration, or until you die. If that happens, you can go back to your Garrison and find him in the same tree. His respawn time is around 5 minutes.

## The History of Pepe

When Pepe was first added into the game, nobody expected him to become famous and loved by the community so quickly. This little guy caught our eyes as well as our hearts and has since been getting more and more items related to him, which we can't get enough of. Pepe is the creation of [Jordan Powers](http://jordtron5000-blog.tumblr.com/post/103210830261/i-originally-created-pepe-to-help-breathe-some), who started adding Pepe to all of his work to add more flavoring to it, as well as the fact that he loved the little guy.

Pepe was initially added in the game as a joke, like an easter egg, but [Jeremy Feasel](https://twitter.com/Muffinus) decided that he'd make it a bird that sits on people's heads.
