# Dog

Dog is your loyal companion from Valley of the Four Winds. In this guide we'll go over how to make her show up in your Garrison from Draenor and in the Pet Menagerie from Dalaran.

## Pandaria - Sunsong Ranch

[Lost Dog](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/59533-lost-dog) can be found in the Valley of the Four Winds. At 12600/21000 reputation with [The Tillers](https://www.wowdb.com/factions/1272-the-tillers) you will be able to pick up the quest [Lost and Lonely](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/30526-lost-and-lonely) and once you complete it, [Dog](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/59536-dog) will join you at the Sunsong Ranch.

> Lost Dog says: Woof!
> The dog wags its tail happily. It heads toward your farm!

## Draenor - Garrison

In Draenor, [Dog](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/87553-dog) follows us and sits near our Herb Garden in the Garrison.

> Dog wags its tail, trying very hard to stay seated and not jump on you. It's happy to see you again after so long.

## Legion - Dalaran

After Legion launched, [Dog](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/87553-dog) was left alone in the Garrison, until a way to teleport her to Dalaran was implemented in Patch 7.2. To solve this secret you're going to need a [Pebble](https://www.wowdb.com/items/147420-pebble), which can be found scattered throughout Dalaran.

Note that these Pebbles are really small, so you might have to zoom in to find them. Check out the following [comprehensive map](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Dalaran-Loose-Pebbles.jpg) made by Kruithne for their spawn locations.

Loot one of these [Pebbles](https://www.wowdb.com/items/147420-pebble), go to your Garrison and give the Pebble to Dog, and then he will show up in the Pet Menagerie in Dalaran.

> \> Show the stone from Dalaran's streets to the dog.
> Dog sniffs the stone and licks your hand reassuringly.

> Dog's coat is gleaming, and it looks quite healthy. Breanni is clearly taking very good care of it.

> But how did it get here?
