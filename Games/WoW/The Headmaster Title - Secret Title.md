The [Headmaster / Headmistress](https://www.wowdb.com/titles/494-headmaster) Title is a character-bound hidden title added in the Legion expansion.

First you will have to complete an Archaeology quest chain that starts off with the quest [Academic Exploration](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/41183-academic-exploration) in Dalaran. [Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/103482-taethelan-bloodwatcher) hands out the next quest and can be found in Azsuna, east from the Illidari Strand.

Upon completing the quest chain, you will be awarded with a [Key to Nar'thalas Academy](https://www.wowdb.com/items/131744-key-to-narthalas-academy).

Using this item in the Hall of Arcane Learning will phase you to a time-warped version of the room where you can do more mini-games such as rune drawing and picture fighting. Here you will also find [Elya Azuremoon](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/112111-elya-azuremoon) who you may duel after completing all the activities (although note that you might be able to duel her without completing any activities).

Challenge Elya Azuremoon to a duel, and if you defeat her, your character (and any others who were in a party with you) will get the Headmaster/Headmistress title.
