# Trashmaster Title

The [Trashmaster](https://www.wowdb.com/titles/650-trashmaster) Title is a character-bound hidden title added in the Battle for Azeroth expansion. You can permanently unlock the title by completing a few tasks for Jani.

## Step 1 - Get the Trashmaster's Mantle

[Trashmaster's Mantle](https://www.wowdb.com/items/168970-trashmasters-mantle) has a chance to drop from [K.U.-J.0.](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/144246-k-u-j-0) in Operation: Mechagon.

You can use a [Seal of Wartorn Fate](https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1580-seal-of-wartorn-fate) for an additional chance to get the cloak when defeating K.U.-J.0. on Mythic difficulty.
