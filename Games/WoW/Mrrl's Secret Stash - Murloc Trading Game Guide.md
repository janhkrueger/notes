## Unlocking Mrrl

To unlock Mrrl, go to coordinates **48 45** in Nazjatar, pick up [A Safer Place](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/55530-a-safer-place) / [A Safer Place](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/55983-a-safer-place) and escort Mrrl to Newhome or Mezzamere. Once you complete this quest, Mrrl will summon four murloc traders: Mrrglrlr, Grrmrlg, Flrgrrl and Hurlgrl.

In the follow-up quest [No Backs](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/55529-no-backs) you will have to talk to each murloc trader and purchase one item from them.

## Murloc Traders' Special Stocks

To get access to the Murloc Traders' Special Stocks, you will need the [Azsh'ari Stormsurger Cape](https://www.wowdb.com/items/169489-azshari-stormsurger-cape) which grants you the [Trader's Stock](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/302380-traders-stock) buff.

You can get the cloak from doing world quests and defeating rares in Nazjatar, but you can also purchase it from Finder Palta in Newhome or Artisan Itanu in Mezzamere. Note that one [Benthic Cloak](https://www.wowdb.com/items/169481-benthic-cloak) costs 5 [Prismatic Manapearls](https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1721-prismatic-manapearl) and there are four different type of cloaks that you can get, so you might need to purchase quite a few cloaks to get the [Azsh'ari Stormsurger Cape](https://www.wowdb.com/items/169489-azshari-stormsurger-cape).
