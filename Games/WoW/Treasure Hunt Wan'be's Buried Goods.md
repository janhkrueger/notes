Treasure Hunting is a challenging and fun mini game in which players follow a trail of clues in order to find the hidden treasure. This is also the case for Wan'be's Buried Goods, one of the treasure hunts available to Horde players in Battle for Azeroth.

To start this treasure hunt you have to get the [Ghostly Explorer's Skull](https://www.wowdb.com/items/163213-ghostly-explorers-skull) from [Hoarder Jena](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/135804-hoarder-jena), the emissary vendor for the Voldunai.

## Ghostly Explorer's Skull

Place the [Ghostly Explorer's Skull](https://www.wowdb.com/items/163213-ghostly-explorers-skull) on the floor anywhere to summon the spirit of Wan'be the Explorer. Speak with Wan'be to open a dialogue window where he expresses his thoughts.

> When we go'n ta visit somewhere nice?  
> This place look interestin.  
> Ooh, where we be today?  
> Tis a bit cold here isn't it? Or dat just me?  
> Dis place seems pleasant. I could haunt here.

[Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe) will also mention a thought or an anecdote that hints to a specific location in Azeroth. You'll have to take the skull to those locations and serve as a guide to Wan'be in his afterlife.

## Step 1: The sabers in the snow

> You ever see a saber in the snow? That be a crazy idea, snow that is.

You will have to take him to **Winterspring**, specifically to **Frostsaber Rock**, located at the northernmost part of the area, since this is where most of the snow sabercats live in Azeroth.

Once in Frostsaber Rock use the skull to summon [Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe) and then speak with him.

> \> This what you had in mind?
> 
> I think I feel colder, that possible?

## Step 2: Biggest reptiles of all time

> We got da' big reptiles in Zandalar, nun be big'r in all of time.

This time you'll have to take the skull to Zaladormu in the **Caverns of Time**, to prove [Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe) wrong, since Zaladormu is bigger than most dinosaurs in Zandalar.

You will have to place the skull on the **floor in front** of Zaladormu, **NOT** on the platform he's laying on.

> \> You were saying?
> 
> That tis not a real reptile... Don't tell him I said that.

## Step 3: The flooded desert racing track

> You know, I almost setup a racing ring in Vol'dun. Me partner worried another cataclysm might put us under water and backed out. Plus we had no money, dey took it, when we exiled.

This hints towards a racing track in a desert, which was submerged underwater by the Cataclysm: the **Raceway Ruins in Thousand Needles.** You will find the Raceway Ruins **under Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge**, the ship in the middle of the water.

Note that you must summon the skull underwater to get the right dialogue. Speak with [Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe) to continue.

`/way Thousand Needles 78.8 77`

> \> You gesture around the area.
> 
> Ok, so it can hap'n... you be turning blue... and don't you be leav'n me here.

## Step 4: Living in a volcano

> Did I tell ya, I ov'r heard one of those charcoal half pints claim he lived in a volcano.

The hint this time points to **Blackrock Mountain** where Dark Iron dwarves live. You'll have to place the skull **inside Blackrock Mountain** and then speak to [Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe).

> \> It's hot in here.
> 
> Wan'be: I feel'n fine. Seems like a cozy place.

## Step 5: The buried goods

After all the steps have been completed, you'll have a final conversation with [Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe).

> \> You have something you want to talk about?  
> Wan'be: I have to admit, you be da best guide a skull could ask for.
> 
> \> Thanks, I guess...  
> Wan'be: I feel I's owe you your deposit from way back. So I be lett'n you in on my buried goods.
> 
> \> Buried goods?  
> Wan'be: Yeah, sometin I tucked away before they caught me. All you need ta do is find the tower just off the Rootway near the river in Nazmir. It be der at the foot.

After finishing the conversation, you will be able to find and loot [Wan'be's Buried Goods](https://www.wowdb.com/objects/296454-wanbes-buried-goods). The hint is a bit misleading, since **the goods aren't in Nazmir, but in Zuldazar**, although very close to the river that separates one from the other.

Use the following TomTom command while in Zuldazar, but outside Dazar'alor.

`/way 63.6 9.8 Wan'be's Buried Goods`

When you loot the goods you will receive 120 gold. [Wan'be](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143129-wanbe) will also appear and say:

> There, should even be enough for a tip!
