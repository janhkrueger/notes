# Selfie Camera Secret Filters

In patch 7.3.5 Blizzard has added five secret filters for the Selfie Camera, which are based on famous locations throughout the game (more specifically, certain raids).

In order to obtain these secret filters you will have to take selfies with the [S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera MkII](https://www.wowdb.com/items/122674-s-e-l-f-i-e-camera-mkii).
