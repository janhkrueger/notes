# Warlock Green Fire

The Warlock Green Fire is a special visual effect for Destruction Warlocks. To unlock it you will have to complete a series of warlock-exclusive quests related to the Council of the Black Harvest.

After defeating Kanrethad Ebonlocke and completing the Pursuing the Black Harvest scenario you will learn [The Codex of Xerrath](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/101508-the-codex-of-xerrath), a passive Warlock ability that corrupts all of your Warlock fire spells, infusing them with fel magic.

## Warlock Green Fire Questline

To start the questline you will have to use the [Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion](https://www.wowdb.com/items/92426-sealed-tome-of-the-lost-legion) in combination with a [Healthstone](https://www.wowdb.com/items/5512-healthstone). This tome drops from rare mobs on the Isle of Thunder, but you can also purchase it on the Auction House.

The tome can only be looted by Warlocks, and upon accepting or completing the quest, that character won't be able to obtain the tome again. The quest chain is the following:

-   [An Unusual Tome](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32295-an-unusual-tome)
-   [Reader for the Dead Tongue](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32307-reader-for-the-dead-tongue)
-   [Enlistment Orders](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32311-enlistment-orders) for Horde; [Enlistment Orders](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32312-enlistment-orders) for Alliance
-   [A Tale of Six Masters](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32309-a-tale-of-six-masters) for Horde; [A Tale of Six Masters](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32310-a-tale-of-six-masters) for Alliance
-   [Slaughter Selenora](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32314-slaughter-selenora) for Horde; [Hunt Helheim](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32313-hunt-helheim) for Alliance
-   [Seeking the Soulstones](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32317-seeking-the-soulstones)
-   [Seek the Signal](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32324-seek-the-signal)
-   [Infiltrating the Black Temple](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/32325-infiltrating-the-black-temple)

Upon completing the quest chain, you will learn [The Codex of Xerrath](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/101508-the-codex-of-xerrath). Anyone that was fortunate enough to complete this prior to the release of Warlords of Draenor, also got the [Breaker of the Black Harvest](https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9016-breaker-of-the-black-harvest) Feat of Strength achievement and "of the Black Harvest" title, which are both now unobtainable.

You can turn the fel fire effect on and off by visiting [Jubeka Shadowbreaker](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/70270-jubeka-shadowbreaker) in Shadowmoon Valley.
