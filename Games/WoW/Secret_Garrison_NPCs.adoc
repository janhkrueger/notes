Garrisons are one of the main features of Warlords of Draenor, where players gather resources, construct buildings, recruit followers and prepare their army to stand against their enemies.

To customize your Garrison and give it some flavor, you can recruit several **Secret NPCs** throughout Draenor.

In this guide we'll go over all the Secret NPCs which are broken down by zone, mention if the NPCs are Horde or Alliance only, and list fun facts about recruiting them!

=== Pepe

Pepe is one of the most beloved and faithful companions in World of Warcraft. Added in Warlords of Draenor, he quickly took over our hearts and became a little celebrity. Nowadays, rarely anyone chooses to venture into new content alone, and with [Pepe](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/181943-pepe), you've got a friend with you all the time!

For both Horde and Alliance players, Pepe can be found in the first tree on the left after exiting the main building in the Level 3 Garrison. When interacting with him, you will get a 1 hour buff that reads "You've got a friend!" which is adorable on its own. Pepe will sit on your head for that duration, or until you die. If that happens, you can go back to your Garrison and find him in the same tree. His respawn time is around 5 minutes.

For more info about this lovely companion and how to unlock his costumes, and how to get his toys and achievements visit our guide about [Pepe](https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/pepe) in the [Secrets Database](https://warcraft-secrets.com/secrets).
