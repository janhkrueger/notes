# Allied Races

## Unlocking Mechagnomes

The requirements for unlocking the Mechagnome Allied Race are as follows:
* __[The Mechagonian Threat](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=13553/the-mechagonian-threat) Achievement__: This achievement requires completion of the Mechagon storyline, which should take several hours and a dungeon run to complete. Reference the Comprehensive Mechagon Guide if you need assistance with any quest.
* __[Allied Races: Mechagnome](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=14013/allied-races-mechagnome)__: You must then complete a special questline which demonstrates the ingenuity of Gnomes and Mechagnomes working together.

After completing these, you will have earned the  [Allied Races: Mechagnome](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=14013/allied-races-mechagnome) achievement, will receive  [Mechagonian Tabard](https://www.wowhead.com/item=174068/mechagonian-tabard?bonus=0) and   [Mechagon Mechanostrider](https://www.wowhead.com/item=174067/mechagon-mechanostrider), and can create your own Mechagnome.

The Mechagon story line and Rustbolt Resistance reputation can be completed on __either Alliance or Horde characters__. However, the unlock scenario must be completed on an Alliance character.
