Terky is a secret white murloc battle pet obtained from looting the [White Murloc Egg](https://www.wowdb.com/items/22780-white-murloc-egg) in Borean Tundra.

[Terky](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/16445-terky)'s new source wasn't known until [one month and a half after the release of Patch 6.2.2](https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/655622054478147584).
