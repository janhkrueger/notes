# Leveling Consumables in World of Warcraft

## Experience-Increasing Items
* Draught of Ten Lands Icon Draught of Ten Lands is purchasable for Warfront Service Medals in your faction's main hub from the Battle for Azeroth expansion and increases your main stats by 20 (flat increase, not %), and XP gained by 10% for 1 hour.
* Battle Standard of Coordination Icon Battle Standard of Coordination is a placeable item that increases your XP gains from killing mobs within 100 yards of it by 15%. There are weaker versions that do not share a cooldown with it in Standard of Unity Icon Standard of Unity and Banner of Cooperation Icon Banner of Cooperation. We recommend using these often when killing large amounts of mobs, and you should rotate between them to ensure they are always on cooldown.
