## Mesmerizing Fruit Hat Fun Facts

An amusing use of this item can be witnessed if used in your Garrison. Guards and other NPCs around you will start dancing and proceed to form a conga line behind you, following you through your Garrison's premises. Although, if you stand idle for too long, they will start to disperse and go back to their usual business.

Bear in mind that deleting this item from your inventory won't let you loot it again on that character. Another notable thing to mention is that you shouldn't use this item in front of a boss. Just like everyone, they love to be part of the conga line as well.
