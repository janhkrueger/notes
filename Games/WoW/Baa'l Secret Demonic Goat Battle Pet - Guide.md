### Fifth Pebble

This pebble is located in Voldun. The cave is near the tree and takes a small amount of climbing to get to. Get as high as you can on the island and jump down. Beware the angry Krolusk! Make sure to use a [Draenic Invisibility Potion](https://www.wowdb.com/items/116268-draenic-invisibility-potion) or [Skaggldrynk](https://www.wowdb.com/items/127840-skaggldrynk) to avoid him killing you. The pebble is located at the entrance to the cave, in front of the Krolusk.

`/way Vol'dun 63.21 21.33 Beware the angry Krolusk!`

 [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-10.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-10.jpg) [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-11.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-11.jpg)

### Sixth Pebble

 [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-12.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-12.jpg) [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-13.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-13.jpg)

### Seventh Pebble

This pebble is located above Nazmir, in the South Seas, in fatigue waters. Once you're in the South Seas you use the following macro to set up the waypoints:

`/way 50 6 Starting location   /way 54 7 Pebble location`

To get to both locations without any issue you can use the [Feast of the Fishes](https://www.wowdb.com/items/152564-feast-of-the-fishes). Make sure to place it on the shore of Vol'dun or Nazmir while you are in the water.

If you can't get the [Feast of the Fishes](https://www.wowdb.com/items/152564-feast-of-the-fishes), then you can use an [Elixir of Water Walking](https://www.wowdb.com/items/8827-elixir-of-water-walking) or the [Anglers' Water Striders](https://www.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders) to walk on water. As you can see in the screenshot below, the starting location is in a safe area (the white texture on the minimap).

[![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-Seventh-Pebble-Starting-Location-Screenshot.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-Seventh-Pebble-Starting-Location-Screenshot.jpg)

On your way to the pebble you will take fatigue damage so you will have to get there fast. If you're using the [Feast of the Fishes](https://www.wowdb.com/items/152564-feast-of-the-fishes) then you can go straight to the back of the ship in the water. You will find the pebble below the skull on the left, as shown in the screenshots below.

If you're using the [Elixir of Water Walking](https://www.wowdb.com/items/8827-elixir-of-water-walking) or the [Anglers' Water Striders](https://www.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders), then once you get to **54 7** dismiss your mount and use one of the consumables below to increase your swim speed.

-   [Underlight Angler](https://www.wowdb.com/items/133755-underlight-angler)
-   [Swim Speed Potion](https://www.wowdb.com/items/6372-swim-speed-potion) or [Darkwater Potion](https://www.wowdb.com/items/76096-darkwater-potion)

### Twelfth Pebble

This pebble is located in an underwater cave in Boralus. The pebble is near a rock pillar.

`/way Boralus 10.01 82.59 Underwater cave`

 [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-24.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-24.jpg) [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-25.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-25.jpg)

### Thirteenth Pebble

This pebble is located in a cave past a fatigue area, at the end of the ocean. You will need to use the [Elixir of Water Walking](https://www.wowdb.com/items/8827-elixir-of-water-walking) or the [Anglers' Water Striders](https://www.wowdb.com/items/168416-anglers-water-striders) to walk on the water. The pebble is located just inside the cave entrance. Disregard the other pebbles in the cave, they're just a distraction.

Coordinates no longer work since the last TomTom addon update. Follow the direction like in the video below, and once you get to the first safe spot you can follow the white texture on the minimap.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBhuaMQ4iUo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

 [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-26.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-26.jpg) [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-27.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-27.jpg)

The text on the pebble reads:

> (Something is carved into the stone)
>
> Heckler of the Murkiest Thugs, sheathe your
> Bat and remove the Keg Cork, Wot?

## Baa'l

> Heckler Murkiest Thugs -> Kurgthuk the Merciless
> Bat Keg Cork Wot -> Get Back to Work

The text has been decoded as an anagram by rearranging the letters, and it points to [Kurgthuk the Merciless](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/84506-kurgthuk-the-merciless) Frostfire Ridge, which yells "GET BACK TO WORK!". Close to this NPC there is a volcano, and it the middle of it you will find Baa'l.

Initially, Baa'l is nearly impossible to kill because he is empowered, however you can reduce his health points by summoning [Uuna](https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/uuna), provided that you have completed [her storyline](https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/uuna) including the World Tour.

> Uuna yells: Eat stars, bad guy!
> Uuna yells: Get him, friend! Use your pet battle attack

Note: In case Baa'l's health points don't get reduced, then you should switch War Mode off. You can also try the [Gastropod Shell](https://www.wowdb.com/items/98136-gastropod-shell) toy to reset the pet or realm swap until you find a realm where it will work.

`/way Frostfire Ridge 62 22 Baa'l`

 [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-Pet-Location.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-Pet-Location.jpg) [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-Pet.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Baal-Pet.jpg)

Baa'l will say ominous things when summoned, and if you rearrange the capital letters from the quote below, you can form an anagram for "SEEK KNOWLEDGE".

> Souls fEast on enDless shrieKing, in darKNess they writhe and scream, yOu WiLl join thEm, toGether forEver morE!

## Waist of Time

The secret continues with the hunt for the [Waist of Time](https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/waist-of-time), which is a secret cosmetic belt and the final part of the first major secret in Battle for Azeroth.

Note: To continue this secret questline you must be on the same character that obtained [Baa'l](https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/baal) from the volcano in Frostfire Ridge.
