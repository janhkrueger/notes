== Empty Dish

Next you'll have to find Donni Anthania, the Crazy Cat Lady, at **44.2 53.1** in Elwynn Forest and interact with the Empty Dish inside her house. If you don't see the Empty Dish then go back and talk with Amara Lunastar.

== Miscellaneous Stuff (Archive)

**Note:** Everything below is an archive for the secret.

If you've talked to Amara, a few things will happen inside the Karazhan Dungeon:

-   Two sets of kibbles spawn in the Opera Hall
-   79 Foods and Beverages spawn throughout the Dungeon
-   Sebastian's dialogue changes

=== Kibble

Once you have talked with Amara, two sets of 4 Kibble can now be found in the [Opera Hall](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Karazhan-Food-and-Drinks.jpg) from Karazhan.

 [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Kibble-Set-1.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Kibble-Set-1.jpg) [![](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Kibble-Set-2.jpg)](https://warcraft-secrets.com/wp-content/uploads/Kibble-Set-2.jpg)

=== Karazhan Food and Drinks

A number of food and drinks appear in the Karazhan Dungeon after you've talked with Amara. If you pick them up, they will stay in your inventory for 5 minutes. If you place them down, they will despawn after 5 minutes and 20 seconds.

There are 4 items for each food and drink, with the exception of Meaty Morsel where there are only 3, which brings us to a total of 79 items (20 unique items).

=== Karazhan Interactive Map App

Tigger Oni and Llanthta made an https://tiggeroni.github.io/map/index.html[Interactive Map App] for Karazhan Food and Beverages. Check their https://tiggeroni.github.io/[website] for more interactive tools (food ley lines, food shape maker, kibble shape finder).

=== Sebastian The Organist

If you have talked to Amara Lunastar then Sebastian's dialogue changes in Return to Karazhan. He will also perform a clapping emote when you speak with him.

You can find Sebastian The Organist in the Opera Hall.

> **Original Dialogue**
>
> Greetings! Behold one of the finest musical instruments in all of Lordaeron. It's a true honor to perform for the Master and all his guests. Take a seat in the audience, I hear a show is starting soon.
>
> **New Dialogue**
>
> Music is truly the key to happiness.

=== Jenafur Hints

Several hints have been given for the Jenafur secret.

> January 8, 2020
> Four Kibbles bounce in time, Four Kibbles count the time
>
> March 24, 2020
> Kibbles of 4, sets the time, of a 4/4 beat, and defines the lines
>
> May 16, 2020
> Only one thing gets a kitty into the right mood, when you open up a can of just the right food
>
> June 24, 2020
> Finally you'll just need to set the tune, to find the pattern take a top-down zoom
>
> September 12, 2020
> Two piles of treats
> Set the 4/4 beat
> The rest of the stanza
> Is lined up neat
> Upon the tiles
> You place your notes
> Eight morsels make the music
> That our musician wrote

Several clarifications have been given in regards to the secret:

-   Donni Anthania, her kittens and her house are not part of the solution for the current step.
-   The direction of the kibbles near the dish was meant to lead you to Karazhan.
-   The secret is friendly to those hard of hearing and color blind.
-   You can solo the secret as long as you can clear the dungeon by yourself.
-   No pets, toys or previous secrets are required to solve the puzzle.
-   Music volume is not required for the solution, but rather the reward. Make sure you have the sound enabled.
