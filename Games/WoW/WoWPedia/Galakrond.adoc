**Galakrond** was a massive [proto-dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Proto-dragon "Proto-dragon"), who is known as the "progenitor of [dragonkind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon "Dragon")".<sup id="cite_ref-Audience_4-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-Audience-4">[4]</a></sup> He was a threat which five proto-dragons of varying colors united against.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> It is said that from him the [Titans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") created the [Aspects](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Aspect "Dragon Aspect"),<sup id="cite_ref-Audience_4-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-Audience-4">[4]</a></sup> but this is a rumor the Aspects actively encouraged so as to keep the truth about Galakrond a secret from the dragonflights so that no one would follow his path.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

His size alone was greater than all of the Aspects combined,<sup id="cite_ref-Audience_4-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-Audience-4">[4]</a></sup> large enough that the only possible being Galakrond could be compared to was himself.

## History

### Dawn of the Aspects

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Legacies_Galakrond.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20221227203104)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Legacies_Galakrond.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20221227203104)

Galakrond as seen in _[Legacies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Legacies "Legacies")_.

Galakrond who once hunted with his fellow proto-dragons and was seen as benevolent suddenly changed and became terror that caused the other proto-dragons in prehistoric Azeroth to fear him. While the proto-dragons did not know what caused the change in Galakrond, [Keeper](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Keeper "Keeper") [Tyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyr "Tyr") at least blames himself for Galakrond's actions and mutations, saying "We never intended this path. Galakrond should never have journeyed in the direction he did, and we did not prevent it."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Galakrond's mutations were caused by xref:YoggSaron.adoc[Yogg-Saron] corrupting the waters which Galakrond drank from.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

On a day when dozens gathered to hunt, Galakrond appeared and took their prey, terrifying them all. The blue-white proto-dragon [Malygos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malygos "Malygos") was curious as to why Galakrond would hunt in that area when he never had before, to which his new friend [Neltharion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Neltharion "Neltharion") responded that there was more food. Malygos, however, was quick to point out that the food was _their_ food. In addition, Galakrond began to devour dozens of other [proto-dragons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Proto-dragon "Proto-dragon"), which was unthinkable to the others as they didn't practice cannibalism. However, the horror did not end there as it was revealed that those cannibalized by Galakrond rose as undead, called the [Not-living](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Not-living "Not-living"), enslaved to his will.

At Galakrond's command, the not-living hunted their living counterparts and infected those they bit. The proto-dragon [Coros](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Coros "Coros") sought to emulate Galakrond believing that Galakrond would not devour those like him. To this end Coros would meet with Galakrond in secret and inform him of the time and place that [Talonixa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talonixa "Talonixa"), the chosen alpha of the living proto-dragons, decided that the proto-dragon army would venture forth and attack Galakrond. Seemingly pleased with this information and the thought of the feast that he would have Galakrond flew off, seemingly sparing Coros and his fellow cohorts. However, as Coros and his band took off to the sky Galakrond returned and quickly devoured them all.

Despite Talonixa learning of Coros's betrayal and striking at a different place and time Galakrond was able to use not-living forces to lure the proto-dragon to him. Galakrond erupted from the ground when the army was in position and swiftly shattered it. After killing Talonixa, Galakrond was unable to devour the fast of the army due to the actions of Malygos, [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu"), and [Neltharion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Neltharion "Neltharion"). As Malygos broke off to find [Ysera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ysera "Ysera") and [Alexstrasza](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alexstrasza "Alexstrasza"), Galakrond ended engaging in battle against the future aspects only to be driven off by Tyr after being stunned by his hammer.

An unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a [mountain range to the north](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Storm_Peaks "Storm Peaks") and that it was the perfect time to attack. After eating and gathering their strength Tyr and the others met up near Galakrond's slumbering place and would engage the behemoth in battle. During the course of the battle, Tyr's hammer and his [Spark of Tyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spark_of_Tyr "Spark of Tyr") were knocked free from his person and as he reached out to grab the Spark, Galakrond's massive maw came within range and ended claiming both the artifact and Tyr's hand. Pleased by his victory and being further mutated, Galakrond did not even notice when his enemies had left the battle.

After regaining his senses Galakrond found himself unable to find prey as the living had become adept at hiding. With his hunger ever-growing Galakrond, in a move that stunned and surprised the future aspects, began to devour his own not-living as they were the only thing that would not hide from him. Despite his hunger, Galakrond was able to show restraint by keeping enough not-living to serve as a scouting force to hunt down his preferred prey: the living proto-dragons.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fb/Legacies_Chapter_1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20221118070145)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fb/Legacies_Chapter_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20221118070145)

Galakrond and the Aspects at the final battle.

With Tyr out of commission from his wound, the proto-dragons had to battle Galakrond alone. Galakrond and his remaining not-living forces would eventually be attacked by the future Aspects, in what would become known as the [Dragonblight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonblight "Dragonblight"). During the battle, Malygos would be able to lodge a boulder into Galakrond's throat; an action which not only saw Galakrond to focus his attention on dislodging it, instead of combating the others, but also forced him to release his hold on the remaining not-living who then began to attack one another. Despite his best efforts, the actions of Malygos's ice breaths would force the boulder to remain in the place and the boulder would ultimately be lodged further down his throat when Neltharion blasted a not-living into it, causing Galakrond to ultimately choke to death.

Wanting to keep the truth about Galakrond a secret in order to prevent others from following in his path, the aspects encouraged the rumor that the [Titans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") created them from Galakrond.<sup id="cite_ref-DotA_12-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-DotA-12">[12]</a></sup>

### Present day

More than 20,000 years later a taunka named [Buniq](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Buniq "Buniq") was trying to prove herself worthy to her mate [Akiak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Akiak "Akiak"). Akiak along with [Trag Highmountain](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Trag_Highmountain "Trag Highmountain") found her corpse near the remains of Galakrond in Dragonblight. A bone fragment from his corpse was retrieved by Trag. He could see its potential and took it with him.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/5/58/Galakrond%27s_Rest.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20221212000855)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/5/58/Galakrond%27s_Rest.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20221212000855)

Galakrond's remains at [Galakrond's Rest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond%27s_Rest "Galakrond's Rest").

Some time afterwards, the [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King") put [Grand Necrolord Antiok](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Necrolord_Antiok "Grand Necrolord Antiok") in charge of an effort to raise Galakrond into [undeath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath "Plague of Undeath"). These plans were thwarted by adventurers who slew Antiok and ended his rituals.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> When Deathwing attacked Wyrmrest Temple for the second time, Galakrond's boneyard was used by the [Twilight's Hammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight%27s_Hammer "Twilight's Hammer") as an assault point against [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") and his [companions](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer").

Following a meeting between the former aspects, xref:Kalecgos.adoc[Kalecgos] discovered the [Spark of Tyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spark_of_Tyr "Spark of Tyr")\--and later Tyr's hand--within Galakrond's skeleton. The artifact showed Kalecgos visions of the distant past, which caused him to learn the truth about Galakrond. As Kalec was rocked by these visions [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") traveled to Galakrond's skeleton looking for a way to aid her love.

Both Kalec and Jaina encounter the ghost of the [taunka](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Taunka "Taunka") [Buniq](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Buniq "Buniq") in their exploration's of Galakrond's skeleton (Jaina theorized her to be Tyr in disguise). After using the artifact to remind the other former aspects of their duties, Kalec thought he saw Tyr standing at [Galakrond's Rest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond%27s_Rest "Galakrond's Rest").<sup id="cite_ref-DotA_12-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-DotA-12">[12]</a></sup>

Galakrond's bloodline continued into the present day, when his direct descendant [Galakras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakras "Galakras") was ridden by [Warlord Zaela](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlord_Zaela "Warlord Zaela") during the [Siege of Orgrimmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Orgrimmar "Siege of Orgrimmar").

### Magic

When Galakrond started destroying the life essence of proto-dragons by consuming them, he underwent mutations. Eventually, he started to breathe a sickly green mist that Malygos described as "slow death" and reminded him "much too much of that 'breathed' by the not-living."<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Those exposed to this mist became either lethargic as if their lives were slowly seeping out afterwards,<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> or violent.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

-   This shares characteristics with [fel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fel "Fel") [magic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic"), which is created by destroying life energy and<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> manifests as entropic green, causing demonic mutations in those exposed to it, and sometimes makes people more violent or lethargic.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> [Richard A. Knaak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_A._Knaak "Richard A. Knaak") stated that he likes the theory of Galakrond being affected by fel and that it works with what he knows of fel, but that Blizzard instructed him to keep the "green stuff" mysterious.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> However, when [Micky Neilson](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Micky_Neilson "Micky Neilson") was asked if Galakrond was affected by fel energy, he stated that he believes it was just disease.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakrond#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>
-   It may have been a form of [death](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death "Death") magic, given how it gave rise to the not-living and how Galakrond's skin started to decay. Death magic sometimes appears as green, such as the Unholy specialization for [death knights](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_knight "Death knight").
-   It may have been [Decay](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Decay "Decay"), which would explain his rotting flesh and match the sickly green color of Decay as seen in _Dragonflight_.

This ambiguity may be related to his multiple _Hearthstone_ forms above.
