Xe'ra injured, without her core, aboard the _Xenedar_

Xe'ra was one of the first naaru forged during the great ordering of the cosmos,<sup id="cite_ref-HoLaS_8-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-HoLaS-8">[8]</a></sup> and was allegedly "at the Beginning, when mortal life itself was but a distant dream", when she mentioned that she was among those who failed to stop the Legion's rise.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> After the fall of [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus"), the _[Genedar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Genedar "Genedar")_ split into two separate [vessels](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensional_ship "Dimensional ship"). The [draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei")'s finest warriors followed the prime naaru Xe'ra aboard the _[Xenedar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xenedar "Xenedar")_ as the [Army of the Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light "Army of the Light") in an eternal war to bring about the Legion's end. Since then, other survivors of the [Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Crusade "Burning Crusade") have joined the ranks of the Lightforged.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Xe'ra didn't want the Army to know that naaru could fall to the Void, something they would only learn on [Eredath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eredath "Eredath") with [L'ura](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/L%27ura "L'ura").<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

[Light's Heart](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light%27s_Heart "Light's Heart"), Xe'ra's sentience core

Even though [Alleria Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner") had been advised against it, she started delving into the [Void](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void "Void"), and left the [Army of the Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light "Army of the Light") under the tutelage of [Locus-Walker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Locus-Walker "Locus-Walker"). She would eventually return to the _Xenedar_, and aid the Army against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"). Xe'ra tried to convince her to abandon her endeavor and keep to the Light, but Alleria refused. Although X'era was eventually dissuaded by Turalyon from inflicting harsher punishment, and despite Alleria's arguments that they were not enemies despite their different affiliations, she nevertheless had Alleria imprisoned aboard the _[Xenedar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xenedar "Xenedar")_, at least until she accepted "the path of righteousness" once again.<sup id="cite_ref-Mother_1-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Mother-1">[1]</a></sup>

Xe'ra focused all her efforts into aiding the champions of xref:Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth] and sent her core, referred to as [Light's Heart](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light%27s_Heart "Light's Heart"), to aid them, though this action weakened her.<sup id="cite_ref-Mother_1-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Mother-1">[1]</a></sup>

### Legion

[![Legion](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Legion-Logo-Small.png/revision/latest?cb=20150808040028)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "Legion") **This section concerns content related to _[Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "World of Warcraft: Legion")_.**

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/73/In_the_House_of_Light_and_Shadow.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20171001012708)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/73/In_the_House_of_Light_and_Shadow.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171001012708)

[Order](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Class_order "Class order") [champion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer")'s concisousness projected to Xe'ra's astral presence at the "crucible of creation" in the [Great Dark Beyond](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Dark_Beyond "Great Dark Beyond").

Light's Heart cut a swathe through the [Felstorm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felstorm "Felstorm") above the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras"), and radiated enough power that [Silver Hand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_the_Silver_Hand "Knights of the Silver Hand") scouts could feel it coursing through their body. It fell near the coast of [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar") where it was first found by [gilgoblins](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gilgoblin "Gilgoblin"), who brought it to a [sea giant](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_giant "Sea giant"), from whom an [order](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Class_order "Class order") [champion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") sent by [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar") would retrieve it. A message from [High General Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") revealed that Light's Heart had been sent as the [Army of the Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light "Army of the Light")'s last resort as they were fighting their final war against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"). He then asked for the core to be handed to [Prophet Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prophet_Velen "Prophet Velen").

At the _[Exodar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Exodar "Exodar")_, Velen recognized Light's Heart and stated that it could only be unlocked by another naaru in Xe'ra's line, of which [O'ros](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/O%27ros "O'ros") was the last remaining. For that very reason, O'ros was killed during the [Battle for the Exodar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_the_Exodar "Battle for the Exodar") by [Rakeesh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_General_Rakeesh "High General Rakeesh"), who did not want Velen to obtain the information contained with the core. However, the [Tears of Elune](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tears_of_Elune "Tears of Elune") still managed to open Light's Heart at Khadgar's suggestion.

Upon doing so, the spirit of the order champion was sent to Xe'ra. There, she told them about her prophecy regarding [Illidan Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage "Illidan Stormrage"), the "child of Light and Shadow", destined to end the age of demons. Through Light's Heart, she would later continue to communicate with the [champion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") charged to protect her core and try to guide them towards "redemption", as in her eyes the champion's participation (if applicable) in the [death of Illidan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage_(tactics) "Illidan Stormrage (tactics)") at the [Black Temple](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Temple "Black Temple") was a terrible mistake. Xe'ra claimed that once their work of reuniting Illidan's body with his soul was done, her final task would be complete and she would be lost to the [Great Dark Beyond](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Dark_Beyond "Great Dark Beyond").<sup id="cite_ref-Awakenings_12-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Awakenings-12">[12]</a></sup> However, after Illidan was made whole again, Xe'ra was not lost.

#### Shadows of Argus

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/1e/Xe%27ra_binds_Illidan.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20170829202736)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/1e/Xe%27ra_binds_Illidan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170829202736)

Xe'ra forcefully filling Illidan with the Light.

Turalyon, Alleria, and a champion from Azeroth later traveled to the _Xenedar_, which crashed in [Krokuun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krokuun "Krokuun"), where they found the gravely injured Xe'ra and teleported her to the _[Vindicaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicaar "Vindicaar")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Mother_1-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Mother-1">[1]</a></sup> Light's Heart was placed back at her center, and Xe'ra awakened. She asked Illidan to join the Light and fulfill his destiny, but Illidan refused. Xe'ra thus forcefully bound Illidan in chains of light and attempted to fulfill her own prophecy by force. The demon hunter however broke free, and destroyed Xe'ra. An enraged Turalyon accused Illidan of dooming them all and attempted to strike him down, but Illidan blocked Turalyon's blow and told him that his faith had blinded him. According to Illidan, there was no chosen one, only they could save themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-Child_2-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Child-2">[2]</a></sup> Velen would comment that her loss was a blow and condemned Illidan killing her along with Xe'ra's attempting to force destiny upon them.<sup id="cite_ref-TBH_4-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-TBH-4">[4]</a></sup> Artificer Rommul would also say Xe'ra's loss was his most troubling experience in the conflict thus far.

The shards of Xe'ra were collected by Velen, who swore that the Light did not die with her and shone in each of them.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Xe'ra's light was then safeguarded within the [Netherlight Crucible](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Netherlight_Crucible "Netherlight Crucible").<sup id="cite_ref-An_Offering_of_Light_14-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-An_Offering_of_Light-14">[14]</a></sup>

## Notes and trivia

-   [Archmage Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Khadgar "Archmage Khadgar") believed, based on a passage from an ancient cosmology tome he found in xref:Karazhan.adoc[Karazhan], that the [prime naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_naaru "Prime naaru") may have been created by [Elune](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elune "Elune").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
-   Her interaction with the player is different if they are a demon hunter. Instead of blaming them for murdering Illidan and trying to guide them towards salvation, the xref:Illidari.adoc[Illidari] leader, having sided with Illidan, is praised, and her goal with them is to make them understand Illidan's true goal and the sacrifices he made.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
-   [A'dal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A%27dal "A'dal"), the leader of a group of naaru called the [Sha'tar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sha%27tar "Sha'tar"), condoned Illidan's death.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> It is unknown if A'dal knew about Xe'ra or about her prophecy, or if he did but still went against her. However, Xe'ra knew about [Tempest Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tempest_Keep "Tempest Keep"), the Sha'tar's [dimensional fortress](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensional_ship "Dimensional ship"), and her descendant O'ros was aboard the _Exodar_, Velen's dimensional ship, which points towards some form of a link.
-   Xe'ra's affinity towards Illidan at first became suspicious among the fanbase. Speculations like Xe'ra being a kind of false illusion (perhaps created by Kil'jaeden) quickly spread. Illidan himself, at first, believed this about the "elder naaru" that he met as well, thinking that Kil'jaeden was not called "the Deceiver" for nothing. However, this was proven false when the elder naaru then rescued Illidan from having his spirit captured or destroyed by [Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden "Kil'jaeden") as he was attempting to set up a portal between [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus") and [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland"). Kil'jaeden roared in rage when Illidan managed to escape with the naaru's aid.<sup id="cite_ref-Illidan_Novel_19-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Illidan_Novel-19">[19]</a></sup> Xe'ra eventually died on [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus"), ironically by Illidan's hand.
-   Turalyon would come to agree that Xe'ra had been in the wrong. He later stated to [Anduin Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Wrynn "Anduin Wrynn") at the [Gathering](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gathering "Gathering") that paladins and priests should let the Light guide them, but never command them, and make use of one's mind and heart as well. Anduin was aware that Turalyon was referring to Xe'ra.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Even long before this, Velen (possibly recalling Illidan's arguments that he must forge destiny by his own hands), while acknowledging Xe'ra's nobility and relentless defiance in the face of the Legion,<sup id="cite_ref-An_Offering_of_Light_14-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-An_Offering_of_Light-14">[14]</a></sup> had also mentioned that even the Light Mother could not be allowed to force destiny upon others.<sup id="cite_ref-TBH_4-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-TBH-4">[4]</a></sup>
-   In one of the visions of a possible future, shown by the [Void](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void "Void"), [Alleria Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner") saw Xe'ra declaring her a [heretic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heretic "Heretic") and calling for her death.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>
-   It is unclear why the [Lightforged draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightforged_draenei "Lightforged draenei") took no action against Illidan after Xe'ra's destruction at his hands, despite having loyally served and revered the Prime Naaru for thousands of years, although it is possible that the majority were just as genuinely surprised by her compulsion of Illidan to embrace the Light, and Velen, who disapproved of her action, was able to persuade the other draenei to leave Illidan alone, especially at the crucial point of their decisive conflict against the Legion.
-   Xe'ra is the first confirmed female naaru as evidenced by her bearing the title of "Light Mother" as well as both Velen and Turalyon referring to Xe'ra as "she", rather than "it".<sup id="cite_ref-Mother_1-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Mother-1">[1]</a></sup> She also has a feminine voice.<sup id="cite_ref-HoLaS_8-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-HoLaS-8">[8]</a></sup>
    -   Before her, K'ara was referred to as a "she" by [alternate Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Velen_(alternate_universe) "Velen (alternate universe)"), but the written text and voice over didn't match,<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> and _[World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 1](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Chronicle_Volume_1 "World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 1")_ referred to K'ara as "it".
-   Xe'ra is voiced by [Kate Higgins](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_Higgins "Kate Higgins").
-   Before [Patch 7.3.0](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_7.3.0 "Patch 7.3.0"), Xe'ra used a classic white [naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naaru "Naaru") model during her appearance in  ![N](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/cb/Neutral_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20110620220434) \[45\] [In the House of Light and Shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_House_of_Light_and_Shadow).<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
-   The character of Xe'ra was created to explore the idea that not all naaru are necessarily good from the player's perspective, with naaru all having their own distinct personalities and goals (such as the aforementioned actions of A'dal). While Xe'ra believed that she was indeed doing good, that good was not necessarily good for everyone.<sup id="cite_ref-Blizzblizz_24-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Blizzblizz-24">[24]</a></sup>

-   Xe'ra may be the "elder naaru" that appeared before Illidan shortly before his demise in the [Black Temple](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Temple "Black Temple"),<sup id="cite_ref-Illidan_Novel_19-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-Illidan_Novel-19">[19]</a></sup> as they shared the same speech and prophecy about Illidan, and were encountered in a similar fashion as the player-character: through their spirits meeting.
-   Xe'ra may be the naaru that appeared to Turalyon in _[Beyond the Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Beyond_the_Dark_Portal "Beyond the Dark Portal")_.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>
-   The [Light Mother](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Mother_(alternate_universe) "Light Mother (alternate universe)") behind the [Lightbound](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightbound "Lightbound") may be the [alternate counterpart](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_universe "Alternate universe") to Xe'ra since they share the same title and are related to an Army of the Light.
-   As a creature born of one of the six powers who was killed outside of their home plane, Xe'ra likely returned to the Light to be reconstituted and was not truly destroyed.
