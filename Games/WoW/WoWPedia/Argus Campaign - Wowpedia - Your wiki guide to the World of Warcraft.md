The **Argus Campaign**<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> (also referred to as the **last battle for Argus**<sup id="cite_ref-GC_2-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-GC-2">[2]</a></sup> or the **Shadows of Argus**<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>) is the battle between the [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth")'s defenders, the [Army of the Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light "Army of the Light") and the [Argussian Reach](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argussian_Reach "Argussian Reach") against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") on [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus").

Despite considerable casualties on both sides, the conflict ultimately resulted in the restoration of the [Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pantheon "Pantheon"), the death of [Argus the Unmaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_the_Unmaker "Argus the Unmaker"), and their successful imprisonment of [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") at the [Seat of the Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Seat_of_the_Pantheon "Seat of the Pantheon"), apparently crippling the Legion and ending the [Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Crusade "Burning Crusade") forever.

## Prelude

Ever since the [Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") [invaded](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_the_Exodar "Battle for the Exodar") the _[Exodar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Exodar "Exodar")_, the [draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei") have been hard at work preparing to return to [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus"). The draenei had completed the construction of the _[Vindicaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicaar "Vindicaar")_, a ship to transport the heroes of Azeroth to invade the Legion's homeworld. The draenei has issued a call to arms to all of Azeroth to support the counter-offensive. The [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance") and the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") have answered the call, with [Lady Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin") and [Aethas Sunreaver](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas_Sunreaver "Aethas Sunreaver") leading the Horde reinforcements, and [Vereesa Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa_Windrunner "Vereesa Windrunner") and [Arator the Redeemer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arator_the_Redeemer "Arator the Redeemer") leading the Alliance reinforcements.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Together, they rendezvoused at [Azuremyst Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azuremyst_Isles "Azuremyst Isles") where they boarded the _Vindicaar_ and made preparations to regroup with the [Army of the Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light "Army of the Light").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

After arriving on Argus, the _Vindicaar_ flew to [Krokuun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krokuun "Krokuun") to rendezvous with the Army of the Light. Once the _Vindicaar_ arrived, the Army of the Light's ship — the _[Xenedar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xenedar "Xenedar")_ — revealed itself. This caught the attention of the Burning Legion's forces on the ground however, and they proceeded to shoot down the _Xenedar_. Before the Legion's forces had a chance to focus fire on the _Vindicaar_, Prophet Velen ordered the Azerothian heroes to make landfall and commence the final battle for Argus.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> While the Legion's [siege weapon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles") was recharging, [Prophet Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prophet_Velen "Prophet Velen") and [Illidan Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage "Illidan Stormrage") led a vanguard of [adventurers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") to the battlefront.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> With Velen shielding the vanguard with the [Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light "Light"), the vanguard went on to destroy the Legion's [Devastators](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Devastator "Devastator")<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and rescued the Legion's [krokul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krokul "Krokul") [slaves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Slave "Slave").<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> After which, the vanguard destroyed the Legion's [fel cannons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fel_cannon "Fel cannon"),<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> slew [demon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon "Demon") reinforcements,<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and culminated the battle by defeating [Antaen Light-Breaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antaen_Light-Breaker "Antaen Light-Breaker") (which the heroes believed to be the Legion's main siege weapon).<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

_[Vindicaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicaar "Vindicaar")_ hovering over Argus

Although the [Armies of Legionfall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Armies_of_Legionfall "Armies of Legionfall") emerged victorious from the battle, they've sustained heavy casualties. Velen proposed to replenish their ranks by recruiting the beleaguered krokul they just liberated from slavery.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Velen tracked the krokul to a [Krokul Hovel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krokul_Hovel "Krokul Hovel"), where he has a reunion with [Chieftain Hatuun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chieftain_Hatuun "Chieftain Hatuun"). Hatuun is bitter Velen had abandoned him and all those who were stranded on Argus to the Legion but [High Exarch Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_Exarch_Turalyon "High Exarch Turalyon") revealed himself and urged the [Broken](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken "Broken") to stand with the Azerothians to defeat the Burning Legion. Turalyon disclosed he was saved by the krokul when the _Xenedar_ crashed but the survivors of the Army of the Light were still fighting for their lives at the crash site.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> After Turalyon regrouped with [Lothraxion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lothraxion "Lothraxion") and the _Vindicaar_,<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Turalyon and the adventurer set out to continue their war against the Burning Legion.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The Broken resistance that Chieftain Hatuun led was called the [Argussian Reach](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argussian_Reach "Argussian Reach") and his collective of Broken identify themselves as Darkfallen. In order to earn the Argussian Reach's trust, Turalyon tasked adventurers with aiding in the dispatching of prominent demons that have been a thorn in the Argussian Reach's side<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> and rescuing more [Darkfallen Slaves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkfallen_Slave "Darkfallen Slave").<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Finally, Turalyon led a strike against [Aggonar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aggonar "Aggonar"), the master of the [Annihilan Pits](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Annihilan_Pits "Annihilan Pits"). The battle nearly went poorly when Aggonar summoned [Burning Fiends](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Fiend "Burning Fiend"), but [Alleria Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner") arrived to turn the tide of battle. The combined might of the heroes was enough to dispatch the [pitlord](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pitlord "Pitlord"), and Turalyon and Alleria were not only relieved to be reunited but also sensed that their son [Arator](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arator_Windrunner "Arator Windrunner") was nearby and they would soon see him again.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> After earning the allegiance of their new Broken allies, Alleria and Turalyon traveled to the _Vindicaar_ were they had an emotional reunion with their son.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

While Alleria and Turalyon secured the _Xenedar_, [Magni Bronzebeard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magni_Bronzebeard "Magni Bronzebeard") revealed that he has been hearing the whispers of [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus") and believes the planet has been reaching out to him. Magni activated the Broken's revered [Sacred Stone](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Stone "Sacred Stone") to witness a vision from Argus itself. Argus' vision revealed that the [titan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") [Aggramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aggramar "Aggramar") has been corrupted by [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") and is now serving as a lord of the Burning Legion. Worse, they appear to be transforming Argus itself and utilizing it for a nefarious purpose.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> After relaying the news to Turalyon, Turalyon surmised that the Burning Legion was harnessing the soul of a titan in order to regenerate their fallen armies in the [Nether](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nether "Nether"). Turalyon believes that if they can destroy the titan, the Burning Legion's ranks will become finite and give the resistance a chance at victory.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Turalyon, Illidan, Velen, and Alleria led their forces to [Destiny Point](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point "Destiny Point") in order to raid [Nath'raxas Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nath%27raxas_Hold "Nath'raxas Hold"). As [Grand Artificer Romuul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Artificer_Romuul "Grand Artificer Romuul") finished repairing his [warframe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warframe "Warframe"),<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Illidan<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> and Alleria led attacks on the demons' front<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> while Velen sanctified their fallen<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> and Turalyon recovered lost Lightforged armaments.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Once Romuul's warframe was operational, the adventurers utilized it to decimate the demons' ranks and close the [Nath'raxxan Rifts](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nath%27raxxan_Rift "Nath'raxxan Rift"). This allowed the armies of the _Vindicaar_ to breach [Nath'raxas Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nath%27raxas_Spire "Nath'raxas Spire")<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> and ultimately slew [Lord Nath'raxas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Nath%27raxas "Lord Nath'raxas"). As the heroes celebrated their victory, Aggramar suddenly arrived. The Army of the Light and the adventurer teleported away before they had to face Aggramar's wrath. Both Turalyon and Alleria were shocked by Aggramar's immeasurable power, while Illidan grimly stated that they must destroy Argus' [World-soul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World-soul "World-soul") in order to break the Burning Legion.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

## Eredath

### Obtaining the Sigil of Awakening

Realizing that the _Vindicaar'_s forces still lacked the strength to breach [Antorus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antorus,_the_Burning_Throne "Antorus, the Burning Throne"), Prophet Velen has decided to form an expedition to [Eredath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eredath "Eredath") and gather the missing two pieces necessary to reconstruct the [Crown of the Triumvirate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crown_of_the_Triumvirate "Crown of the Triumvirate").<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> When Velen arrived at Eredath however, he was troubled to hear that the [naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naaru "Naaru") [L'ura](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/L%27ura "L'ura")'s song of war was still playing, yet distorted.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Velen traveled to [Triumvirate's End](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Triumvirate%27s_End "Triumvirate's End") and activated its defenses in order to ward off the hostile [spirits](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost "Ghost").<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> With Triumvirate's End secured, Velen has the _Vindicaar_ launch a [Lightforged beacon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightforged_beacon "Lightforged beacon") to their location in order to bring in reinforcements and to provide an escape for the expedition if needed.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Reinforced by the Army of the Light, Velen's expedition set off to search for the [Sigil of Awakening](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sigil_of_Awakening "Sigil of Awakening") in the [Conservatory of the Arcane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Conservatory_of_the_Arcane "Conservatory of the Arcane").<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> [Archmage Y'mera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Y%27mera "Archmage Y'mera") and an adventurer reactivated [Vigilant Quoram](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vigilant_Quoram "Vigilant Quoram"), the gatekeeper of the conservatory.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Quoram tasks the adventurer to undergo numerous trials in order to earn the right to obtain the Sigil of Awakening,<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> with the last challenge being to face an [echo of Archimonde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archimonde_(echo) "Archimonde (echo)") in the [Praetorium](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Praetorium "Praetorium").

### Talgath's fall

After securing the Sigil of Awakening in the _Vindicaar_, Turalyon revealed that acquiring the sigil had alerted the Burning Legion and they have sent their forces to Eredath. Velen took [Captain Fareeya](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Fareeya "Captain Fareeya") and her forces into the [Arinor Gardens](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arinor_Gardens "Arinor Gardens") area to search for the [Crest of Knowledge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crest_of_Knowledge "Crest of Knowledge"), putting them directly behind enemy lines.

After rendezvousing with Velen, the Prophet revealed that [Talgath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talgath "Talgath") was here and they had to find the Crest of Knowledge before he did.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> While Turalyon took command of Fareeya's lieutenants and escorted Velen to the Crest of Knowledge, the adventurer proceeded to close the Burning Legion's portals<sup id="cite_ref-QFM_65-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-QFM-65">[65]</a></sup> and whittling away Talgath's forces to clear the way for Velen's party.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> As the adventurer and Velen's party approached [Kil'jaeden's Terrace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden%27s_Terrace "Kil'jaeden's Terrace"), they saw the [Echo of Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Echo_of_Kil%27jaeden "Echo of Kil'jaeden") speaking with the [Echo of Talgath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Echo_of_Talgath "Echo of Talgath") about how they had stored the Crest of Knowledge in the [Seat of the Triumvirate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Seat_of_the_Triumvirate "Seat of the Triumvirate").<sup id="cite_ref-QFM_65-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-QFM-65">[65]</a></sup> Eventually, Velen's party was confronted by Talgath and they were forced to face him in battle. After Velen's group wounded Talgath, he incapacitated the party and tried to flee. Velen, however, broke free of his debilitation and bound Talgath with holy shackles. Velen gave Talgath one last chance to help them find the Crest of Knowledge before terminating him. Talgath mocked their quest and told Velen that "Nothing will escape \[from\] the temple. Not even the Light itself." Velen finished Talgath off with holy fire, but his last words and the echoes of the past confirmed that the relic they're seeking was indeed in the Seat of the Triumvirate.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

### War of Light and Shadow

Velen and Turalyon led their forces back to the _Vindicaar_ where they discussed the recent events. Velen however, suspected that [L'ura](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/L%27ura "L'ura") had transformed into a [dark naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_naaru "Dark naaru") and it would be a major obstacle to the Crest of Knowledge.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> Just as Velen was about to lead an expedition into the Seat of the Triumvirate, Alleria Windrunner appeared to tell Velen that she had scouted the area and revealed L'ura's [Void](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void "Void") energy had lured an army of Void creatures to the temple. Alleria had a plan to breach the Seat of the Triumvirate, but it would require the adventurer's aid. Velen endorsed Alleria's plan<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> and she and the adventurer returned to Triumvirate's End in order to investigate the [Ruins of Oronaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ruins_of_Oronaar "Ruins of Oronaar"). Alleria and the adventurer found the ruins to be rife with the Void's influence. After finding [Fragmented Prayers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fragmented_Prayers "Fragmented Prayers")<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> and witnessing the [Echo of Arkhaan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Echo_of_Arkhaan "Echo of Arkhaan")'s futile attempts to prevent his community from being debased by the Void,<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Alleria and the adventurer located the Broken [Arkhaan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arkhaan "Arkhaan") — the last uncorrupted priest of Oronaar. Alleria and the adventurer tried to restore some semblance of Arkhaan's sanity by cleansing the nearby [Void Manifestations](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Manifestation "Void Manifestation")<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> and slaying the [Void-corrupted Broken](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Voidscarred "Voidscarred") who were once a part of his community.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> After recovering somewhat from his madness, Arkhaan remembered a plan that he believed would lead to his salvation. Alleria and the adventurer followed Arkhaan to [Isolon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Isolon "Isolon"), which appeared to had been calling to Arkhaan and was filled by many Void-corrupted Broken. Arkhaan followed the voices to a [Void Tear](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Tear "Void Tear"), which Alleria and the adventurer followed Arkhaan to. The Void transported Alleria, Arkhaan, and the adventurer to a Void realm, where the [Void ethereal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void_ethereal "Void ethereal") [Viceroy Nezhar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Viceroy_Nezhar "Viceroy Nezhar") corrupted Arkhaan; leaving the adventurer and Alleria little choice but to slay the Void-corrupted Broken while the viceroy escaped. After Arkhaan was slain, Alleria and the adventurer were pulled back to Isolon by [Locus-Walker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Locus-Walker "Locus-Walker").<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

Alleria introduced Locus-Walker as her mentor in the ways of the void and he stated that he too has been investigating the [Shadowguard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowguard "Shadowguard")'s machinations in Argus. After Locus-Walker created a Void Tear, Alleria and the adventurer followed Locus-Walker to the [Umbra Hollows](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Umbra_Hollows "Umbra Hollows"), where they witnessed the Void ethereals preparing to corrupt all of Argus with the Void. With the Void's invasion being imminent, Alleria decided that she should finish her training with Locus-Walker in order to master the void.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> Locus-Walker, Alleria, and the adventurer began to disrupt the Shadowguard's efforts by deactivating their [Void Harvesters](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Harvester "Void Harvester"),<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> and culling their ranks<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> — including [General Zah'd](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/General_Zah%27d "General Zah'd").<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> For the next step of Alleria's training, Locus-Walker tasked Alleria to slay [Nhal'athoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nhal%27athoth "Nhal'athoth") and absorb the void energy of its [heart](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_Nhal%27athoth "Heart of Nhal'athoth"). After accomplishing her task,<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> Alleria sent the adventurer to give the [Remnant of Nhal'athoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Remnant_of_Nhal%27athoth "Remnant of Nhal'athoth") to Velen and to tell him of what they have learned about the void incursions.

Velen believes that the [Essence of Shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Essence_of_Shadow "Essence of Shadow") taken from Nhal'athoth's remnants will be exactly what they need to bring balance to the [Netherlight Crucible](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Netherlight_Crucible "Netherlight Crucible") and give them the edge they need against the Legion.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> With the Netherlight Crucible upgraded, the weapons of the _Vindicaar'_s champions can thus be imbued by both the Light and the Shadow.<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>

### Assault on the Seat of the Triumvirate

Alleria siphons L'ura.

With their forces ready, Velen sent an army of adventurers to aid Alleria and Locus-Walker's attack on the Void-infested Seat of the Triumvirate. As they begin their assault, the party witnessed [Void ethereals](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void_ethereal "Void ethereal") creating Void Tears to infect the land with the Void. Alleria instructed the adventurers to exterminate the battalions of Void ethereals, [voidwalkers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Voidwalker "Voidwalker"), and [Voidscarred](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Voidscarred "Voidscarred") to put an end to the Void proliferation. The adventurers later dispatched [Zuraal the Ascended](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zuraal_the_Ascended "Zuraal the Ascended") — the Shadowguard's first success at creating a Void-infused Broken — at the [Triad's Conservatory](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Triad%27s_Conservatory "Triad's Conservatory"). After which, Alleria used her Void magic to create a hole on a building's wall that was impeding their path, which allowed the party to breach the [Shadowguard Incursion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowguard_Incursion "Shadowguard Incursion"). There, the adventurers faced off against [Saprish](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Saprish "Saprish") and his voracious pets: [Darkfang](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkfang_(panthara) "Darkfang (panthara)") and [Shadewing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadewing "Shadewing"). After Saprish's death, Locus-Walker teleports in to take Saprish's staff for himself. The party then power through to the temple's entrance, where they find [Viceroy Nezhar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Viceroy_Nezhar "Viceroy Nezhar") and his forces trying to break into the temple. After the party dispatched Viceroy Nezhar and his remnant forces, Alleria and Locus-Walker dissipated the Void barrier at the entrance of the temple and prepared for a final showdown with [L'ura](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/L%27ura "L'ura"). Once the party entered the temple, they were forced to slay the dark naaru L'ura. After its defeat, Alleria Windrunner siphons L'ura's Void energy and becomes a [void elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Void_elf "Void elf"). The adventurers take the Crest of Knowledge to Velen at the _Vindicaar_. With all relic components together, Velen takes the Eye of Prophecy from his staff and combined it with the Crest of Knowledge and the Sigil of Awakening; thus reconstituting the Crown of the Triumvirate. Velen then used the Crown of the Triumvirate to empower the _Vindicaar_, coating the ship in a gold light.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

## Invasion Points

While the Burning Legion focused their defenses on Argus, Illidan Stormrage tasked adventurers to take the fight to the Legion on other worlds. By sending his forces through [Invasion Points](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Invasion_Point "Invasion Point") on Argus, Illidan has engineered numerous offensives on other Legion worlds.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>

## Rejection of the gift

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/1e/Xe%27ra_binds_Illidan.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20170829202736)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/1e/Xe%27ra_binds_Illidan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170829202736)

Xe'ra begins to forcefully fill Illidan with the Light.

Back at the Krokul Hovel, Magni Bronzebeard received two more visions from the Sacred Stone. The first vision was from a distressed Argus, and in this vision, Magni witnessed the Burning Legion torturing the [Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pantheon "Pantheon"). Sargeras and Aggramar noted that [Eonar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eonar "Eonar") has yet to be captured, however, but their discussion indicated that they plan to create a [Dark Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Pantheon "Dark Pantheon").<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> The second vision came from Eonar herself, speaking from the [Elarian Sanctuary](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elarian_Sanctuary "Elarian Sanctuary") where her [spirit](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Essence_of_Eonar "Essence of Eonar") lies. Eonar pleaded with Magni and the adventurer to aid her; for if the Burning Legion find her, it would spell the annihilation of everything.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

Back at the _Vindicaar_, Turalyon believed it to be the right time to revive [Xe'ra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra "Xe'ra"). After assembling Xe'ra's components and combining them with [Light's Heart](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light%27s_Heart "Light's Heart"), Xe'ra was consequently restored. After Turalyon welcomed Xe'ra back, Xe'ra expressed its delight that they have found its Chosen One — Illidan Stormrage. Xe'ra wanted to restore Illidan to his original state, before his demonic transformation and when he had golden eyes that signified his great and prosperous future. Illidan however, was reluctant to be healed by Xe'ra's Light and become the Chosen One Xe'ra is trying to make him become. Rather, he is content with seeking the Legion's end in his own form, regardless of how demonic or grotesque it has become. Xe'ra is insistent, however, and tried to transform Illidan with its Light by force. When Xe'ra bound Illidan and attempted to impose its version of Illidan's destiny, Illidan resisted and destroyed Xe'ra with his [Eye Beam](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_Beam "Eye Beam"). Turalyon was enraged by Xe'ra's destruction and struck Illidan with his sword. However, Illidan caught Turalyon's blow and rebuked him for his blind faith in Xe'ra's prophecy. Illidan stated to all that, "There can be no chosen one. Only we... can save ourselves."<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

Prophet Velen sensed that Xe'ra's death had distressed Turalyon and many others and moved to uplift their spirits. Velen told Turalyon that the Light did not die with the [Prime Naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Naaru "Prime Naaru") and that it still shined within all of them. Furthermore, it was imperative that they press on as they still had a world to save. However, Velen would not let Xe'ra's passing go to waste. Velen gathered the [essence of Xe'ra's Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vestige_of_Light "Vestige of Light")<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> and imbued the [Netherlight Crucible](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Netherlight_Crucible "Netherlight Crucible") with it.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>

With their forces prepared for the ultimate battle, Velen set out to create footholds in the [Antoran Wastes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antoran_Wastes "Antoran Wastes") from which they can assault the [Burning Throne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antorus,_the_Burning_Throne "Antorus, the Burning Throne").<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

## Antoran Wastes

In their initial engagements in the [Antoran Wastes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antoran_Wastes "Antoran Wastes"), Illidan Stormrage led his [Illidari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidari "Illidari") to establish the [Veiled Den](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Veiled_Den "Veiled Den") in the north while Alleria Windrunner led the Army of the Light's forces to establish [Light's Purchase](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light%27s_Purchase "Light's Purchase") in the south. However, the two encampments have come under heavy attack and were desperately awaiting reinforcements. The _Vindicaar_ soon arrived and established [Hope's Landing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hope%27s_Landing "Hope's Landing") as their beachhead to reinforce the two fronts.<sup id="cite_ref-Reinforce_Light's_Purchase_91-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-Reinforce_Light's_Purchase-91">[91]</a></sup> Both Alleria and Illidan believed that a direct assault on Antorus would prove too costly with such limited resources at their disposal. With Antorus too heavily defended, the two encampments could do little else but fend off the Legion through guerrilla warfare and assassinations.<sup id="cite_ref-Reinforce_Light's_Purchase_91-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-Reinforce_Light's_Purchase-91">[91]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> As the war carried on, Turalyon and Alleria reunited with [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar") at the _Vindicaar_. Khadgar proposed to have a reunion feast with the [Sons of Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sons_of_Lothar "Sons of Lothar") once the war was won, to which Alleria and Turalyon happily agreed to; all the while jesting that it was Khadgar's turn to buy the drinks. Alleria also spoke with her sister [Vereesa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa_Windrunner "Vereesa Windrunner") about their sister [Sylvanas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner")'s fate. Alleria was shocked and angered to learn that Sylvanas was currently leading the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") that ravaged their people during the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War"). Vereesa wanted to explain to Alleria Sylvanas's [undeath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") and other details as well, but was finding trouble finding the right words. Still, she did her best to give Alleria a proper explanation in private.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> Realizing they still required more resources, High Exarch Turalyon dispatched adventurers to gather [Argunite](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pristine_Argunite "Pristine Argunite") to prepare for their final assault on Antorus.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>

The vessels docked at [Terminus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terminus "Terminus") were taking on [soldiers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier "Soldier") and supplies for the Legion's assaults against [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth"). Champions of [Class Orders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Order "Class Order") were sent to bring the vessels down.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> A great summoning circle in Antoran Wastes called demons from the [Twisting Nether](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twisting_Nether "Twisting Nether") back to Argus. Azeroth's champions were tasked with dismantling the circle and slowing the Legion's reinforcements.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>

### Antorus, the Burning Throne

Sargeras impaling Azeroth

After making the necessary preparations, Turalyon made the decision to begin the attack on [Antorus, the Burning Throne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antorus,_the_Burning_Throne "Antorus, the Burning Throne"). With the _Vindicaar_ empowered by the [Crown of the Triumvirate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crown_of_the_Triumvirate "Crown of the Triumvirate"), the _Vindicaar_ used [Light's Judgment](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light%27s_Judgment_(item) "Light's Judgment (item)") to burn an opening on one of Antorus's massive walls.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> The _Vindicaar_ then sent an army of [adventurers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") and a contingent of its forces to storm the Burning Legion citadel. Turalyon and his Lightforged first faced [Garothi Worldbreaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garothi_Worldbreaker "Garothi Worldbreaker") at the [Edge of Discord](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Edge_of_Discord "Edge of Discord") but they were overwhelmed and forced to retreat. The adventurers relieved Turalyon's forces and destroyed the Legion war machine. After which, Alleria led an assault on the northern front, distracting the Legion while Turalyon, his Lightforged, and [warframe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warframe "Warframe") reinforcements teleported in the Edge of Discord to secure it and press on the attack. The _Vindicaar'_s champions rescued pinned troops<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> and went on to slay the [Felhounds of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felhounds_of_Sargeras "Felhounds of Sargeras") at the [Den of the Devourers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Den_of_the_Devourers "Den of the Devourers"). After which, the Army of the Light occupied the den to provide artillery fire on the bridges while adventurers assaulted [Antoran High Command](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antoran_High_Command "Antoran High Command") at the [Gaze of the Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gaze_of_the_Legion "Gaze of the Legion").<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

The _Vindicaar'_s forces then went on to secure Antorus's portal networks in order to cut off the Legion's reinforcements from other worlds. After adventurers dispatched [Portal Keeper Hasabel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Portal_Keeper_Hasabel "Portal Keeper Hasabel"), adventurers used the Legion's portals to travel to the [Elarian Sanctuary](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elarian_Sanctuary "Elarian Sanctuary"). There they fought the Legion forces of the [Paraxis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Paraxis "Paraxis") in order to defend [Eonar the Life-Binder](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eonar_the_Life-Binder "Eonar the Life-Binder"). After successfully fending off the demon incursion, Eonar urged the adventurers to rescue the rest of the imprisoned [Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pantheon "Pantheon"), for if [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") breaks them as he did Aggramar, no power in the universe would be able to stop him. The adventurers returned to the _Vindicaar_ and went off to assault the [Exhaust](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Exhaust "Exhaust"), the production center of the Legion's arsenal. The adventurers were met by [Imonar the Soulhunter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Imonar_the_Soulhunter "Imonar the Soulhunter"), the Legion's best bounty hunter. After defeating Imonar,<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> the _Vindicaar_ used his runes to bypass the Burning Throne's defenses and struck directly at the [Hallowed Felworks](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hallowed_Felworks "Hallowed Felworks").<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup>

At the Hallowed Felworks, the adventurers defeated [Kin'garoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kin%27garoth "Kin'garoth") — the Legion's top inventor. After Kin'garoth's defeat, the Hallowed Felworks began to collapse. The adventurers then battled their way through the Legion's prison. One of the coven's tortured prisoners, [Varimathras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varimathras_(tactics) "Varimathras (tactics)"), was awaiting the adventurers at the [Chamber of Anguish](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chamber_of_Anguish "Chamber of Anguish"). The vindictive [Coven of Shivarra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Coven_of_Shivarra "The Coven of Shivarra") stripped away both flesh and sanity from Varimathras, leaving only a singular desire to inflict suffering upon the mortals who cost him everything. After the adventurers slew Varimathras, they proceeded to the [Temple of Anguish](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Anguish "Temple of Anguish"), where the [Coven of Shivarra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Coven_of_Shivarra "Coven of Shivarra") worked to subvert the Pantheon. The adventurers slew the Coven of Shivarra<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> and freed the Pantheon's spirits from their tortured imprisonment. Magni Bronzebeard stayed with the Pantheon to help them recover from their traumatic ordeal while Velen, Illidan, and the adventurers moved to liberate Argus's [world-soul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World-soul "World-soul").

Argus's world-soul was being guarded by [Aggramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aggramar_(tactics) "Aggramar (tactics)"), forcing the adventurers to strike him down. With Aggramar's downfall, his essence was set free, allowing him to rejoin his uncorrupted brethren. Prophet Velen collected the [Sigils of the Dark Titan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sigil_of_the_Dark_Titan "Sigil of the Dark Titan") to further upgrade the _Vindicaar'_s power and give the ship enough strength to breach the fetid heart of Argus itself.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> With the Pantheon restored, they teleported Magni, Velen, Illidan, and the adventurers to the [Seat of the Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Seat_of_the_Pantheon "Seat of the Pantheon") where the Pantheon worked to sever Argus's connection to the Burning Legion and imprison Sargeras once and for all.

At the Seat of the Pantheon, however, Sargeras transformed Argus's world-soul into the deadly titan [Argus the Unmaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_the_Unmaker "Argus the Unmaker"). The Pantheon and the heroes of Azeroth fought to destroy Argus the Unmaker, and ultimately slew him, freeing him from millennia of torment, and destroying Sargeras's greatest weapon.<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> With the Legion crippled by the loss of Argus, the Pantheon commended the mortals for saving their world and combined their powers with the last remnants of Argus's essence to forever imprison Sargeras within the Seat. Velen, Magni, and the adventurers went to the _Vindicaar_ to return home, but Illidan stayed behind to become Sargeras's new jailer. Before Sargeras was imprisoned, however, he managed to stab [Silithus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithus "Silithus") with his [massive sword](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_of_Sargeras "Sword of Sargeras"), injuring [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth") severely.

With the Burning Crusade at long last ended, the [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance") and [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") champions returned to their respective homes to celebrate their costly victory against the Legion. However, Sargeras's last spiteful act had dire ramifications. [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar") was the first to witness the power of titan blood<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus_Campaign#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> and the wound inflicted by Sargeras caused Azeroth to hemorrhage. Both the Alliance and the Horde took a keen interest in [Azeroth's blood](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azerite "Azerite") as a potential resource, which soon afterwards helped paved the way for an overwhelmingly devastating [Fourth War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War") between the two factions.

## Notes

-   In the game, the term _Argus Expedition_ is the categorization of the first quests to get to Argus.
-   It is uncertain why none of the [naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naaru "Naaru"), other than several [Prime Naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Naaru "Prime Naaru"), intervened openly to aid the [Army of the Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_Light "Army of the Light") and their Prophet [Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Velen "Velen") in their decisive efforts against the Legion on [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus"), as they were apparently fighting the Legion for thousands of years.
