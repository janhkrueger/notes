An **immortal** is a being who will not die of old age and is generally resistant to sickness and injury. Immortality does not confer an immunity to injury nor death by unnatural means.

## Official Warcraft Encyclopedia

Verbatim from the [Warcraft Encyclopedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_Encyclopedia "Warcraft Encyclopedia"):<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

Many immortal and near-immortal creatures exist in _[Warcraft](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft "Warcraft")_. A number of these creatures are fundamentally incorporeal beings, but others lead a primarily physical existence.

The Nature of Immortality

Immortals in Warcraft are generally resistant to sickness and injury, but immortality does not confer invulnerability. Immortal beings can still be wounded and even killed. Indeed, many immortals have perished over the course of recorded history, particularly during the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients"). The death of an immortal is just as real as any mortal death and, barring a few extraordinary cases, just as permanent.

What, then, does the term immortality mean in Warcraft? Immortal creatures essentially stop aging when they reach adulthood, and thus, they cannot die merely from old age. In addition, they tend to be more powerful than most mortal creatures, although this tendency does not always hold true. Even godhood itself is no guarantee of superior might. Consider the titans' defeat of the [Old Gods](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Gods "Old Gods"). The [titans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") are not gods, but their vast power allowed them to imprison the Old Gods far below the surface of xref:Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth].

The [night elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf") were once immortal

Furthermore, immortality need not be a lasting state of affairs. The [night elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf"), for example, were immortal for thousands of years, but sacrificed their immortality during the xref:ThirdWar.adoc[Third War]. Today they are a mortal race, and they are accordingly classified as such, rather than listed herein.

There are also quite a few races and individuals who have attained immortality after leading a mortal existence. Most [demons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon "Demon") in the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") were once mortal creatures.

Last but not least, there are creatures that can be considered nearly immortal. Technically these beings are mortal, but for one reason or other, they have a lifespan that greatly exceeds several millennia. Indeed, these mortal creatures might even be considered effectively immortal due to some external factor, as with [Ysera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ysera "Ysera")'s consorts, who almost never emerge from the [Emerald Dream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald_Dream "Emerald Dream").

## Night elves

[Night elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf") lore states they were once immortal, granted to them by the [Well of Eternity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Well_of_Eternity "Well of Eternity"). The early night elves gathered around the Well and its energies infused them as they built their civilization.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> They sacrificed the source of their immortality and power during their conflict with the demons of the Burning Legion during the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

After the night elves lost their immortality due to the destruction of the Well of Eternity, [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu"), the Timeless [Dragon Aspect](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Aspect "Dragon Aspect") of the [bronze dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_dragonflight "Bronze dragonflight"), blessed the first [World Tree](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_Tree "World Tree"), [Nordrassil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nordrassil "Nordrassil"), with the gift of immortality. As long as the tree stands, the night elves would forever have the chance to learn.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Nordrassil contained within it the truest, purest essence of [life](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Life "Life") energy on Azeroth.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The [trees of life](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tree_of_life "Tree of life") were enchanted saplings of Nordrassil from which the night elves drew their life energies. These mysterious [ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient "Ancient") were the key to the night elves' immortality and harmonious coexistence with nature.

When Nordrassil was severely damaged during the xref:ThirdWar.adoc[Third War], the night elves again lost their immortality. Some wayward druids sought to reestablish the link between their spirits and the eternal world by planting a special tree.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> This second world tree, [Teldrassil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Teldrassil "Teldrassil"), did not allow the elves to regain their immortality. The promise of immortality associated with Teldrassil came primarily from [Fandral Staghelm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fandral_Staghelm "Fandral Staghelm") and not from any divine beings.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Nozdormu, perhaps tellingly, withheld his blessing due to Fandral's actions during the war against the [qiraji](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Qiraji "Qiraji").<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Fandral's promise has yet to come true.

[Lorekeeper Vaeldrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lorekeeper_Vaeldrin "Lorekeeper Vaeldrin") found scrolls predating [Queen Azshara](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Azshara "Queen Azshara") and sought to find a power that would restore their immortality. This led his expedition to [Pandaria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pandaria "Pandaria") and the [Pools of Youth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pools_of_Youth "Pools of Youth"), which was used during the [mogu empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mogu_empire "Mogu empire") to extend the lives of the mogu. However, Vaeldrin discovered that the waters only transfer life between people.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

-   The servants of [Razelikh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Razelikh "Razelikh")—[Grol](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grol "Grol"), [Sevine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sevine "Sevine"), and [Allistarj](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Allistarj "Allistarj")—were granted nearly unlimited power within the [Blasted Lands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blasted_Lands "Blasted Lands") in exchange for their servitude. Each wore an amulet attuned to the lifeforce of their owner, granting them immortality.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
-   [Mechagnomes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mechagnomes "Mechagnomes") are said to be immortal.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> This counts for both mechagnomes who were not originally flesh gnomes and flesh gnomes who have been turned into mechagnomes, thus being freed from the [Curse of the Flesh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_the_Flesh "Curse of the Flesh").
-   The [undead](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") are considered immortal and will live forever if their body is kept intact.<sup id="cite_ref-DKtweet_14-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-DKtweet-14">[14]</a></sup>
    -   The [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King") offered this type of immortality as a reward to those in the [Cult of the Damned](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cult_of_the_Damned "Cult of the Damned").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
    -   [Meryl Felstorm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Meryl_Felstorm "Meryl Felstorm") achieved this type of immortality through the strength of his own magic.
-   [Elune](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elune "Elune") blessed the [Ancient Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian") [Omen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Omen "Omen") with immortality.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
-   [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu") granted the [tauren](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tauren "Tauren") [Xarantaur](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xarantaur "Xarantaur") and [Jonathan the Revelator](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_the_Revelator "Jonathan the Revelator") immortality, [Baristolth of the Shifting Sands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baristolth_of_the_Shifting_Sands "Baristolth of the Shifting Sands") was saved from death and made ageless by [Anachronos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anachronos "Anachronos"), and [Ralo'shan the Eternal Watcher](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ralo%27shan_the_Eternal_Watcher "Ralo'shan the Eternal Watcher") was also apparently unable to die. The [bronze dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_dragonflight "Bronze dragonflight") themselves appear to be functionally immortal.
-   [Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Velen "Velen") is immortal,<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> and at least some of the [Lightforged draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightforged_draenei "Lightforged draenei") are as well. Though it is unclear whether most ordinary [draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei") are immortal, they are extremely long-lived, since some of them remember [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus") before the draenei fled around 13,000<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> years ago.
-   [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") is considered to be immortal due to his process of becoming [Lightforged](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightforged "Lightforged") at the hands of [Xe'ra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra "Xe'ra").<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Immortal#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Presumably, this is the case for all beings who become Lightforged.
-   The [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") apparently granted something "akin to immortality" to the [high elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf"), its effects reaching even to other planets and dimensions. The [Nightwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell "Nightwell") also apparently made some of the nightborne, such as [Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalyssra "Thalyssra") and [Elisande](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elisande "Elisande"), extremely long-lived, if not immortal themselves.
