— Korialstrasz

**Korialstrasz** was the prime consort of the [Aspect](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Aspect "Dragon Aspect") of Life [Alexstrasza](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alexstrasza "Alexstrasza"). In the guise of the [high elven](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf") [mage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mage "Mage") **Krasus**, he was a senior member of the [Kirin Tor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kirin_Tor "Kirin Tor"), and one of the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six"), the ruling council of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran_(kingdom) "Dalaran (kingdom)").

Korialstrasz was known for his stand-up confidence and self-control, and for being both a fighter and hyper-intelligent.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> He was involved in many important events of [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth")'s history, such as the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients"), the effort to free Alexstrasza from the [Dragonmaw clan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonmaw_clan "Dragonmaw clan"), the restoration of the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"), the [war against the Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_against_the_Lich_King "War against the Lich King"), and the events leading up to and following the [Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm_(event) "Cataclysm (event)"). While tending to the new clutch of red dragon eggs within the [Ruby Sanctum](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Sanctum "Ruby Sanctum"), Korialstrasz sacrificed himself to halt the nefarious efforts of [Twilight's Hammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight%27s_Hammer "Twilight's Hammer").

## Biography

### War of the Ancients

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/ae/Krasus_pic.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210320082318)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/ae/Krasus_pic.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210320082318)

Krasus in _The Well of Eternity_.

At the beginning of the first war against the [Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"), Korialstrasz became incredibly and inexplicably weak. The cause, which Alexstrasza later determined, was Korialstrasz's future self, Krasus, existing the same time period as a result of being flung back from ten thousand years in the future (See _Modern Era_ section below). Neither incarnation was able to shape-shift during this time. After being rescued from Cenarius' glade, Krasus was brought to Life Caverns, home of the Reds, where he was united with his past self. Despite great temptation, Krasus refrained from revealing any future events to anyone, even his queen, from fear of radically altering the future. Aided by a vision from [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu") the Timeless One, the younger and older Korialstraszs then teamed up to find the young [druid](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Druid "Druid") [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malfurion_Stormrage "Malfurion Stormrage"), eventually joining the [night elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf") resistance to the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion")'s invasion. Often, while Krasus led the night elf spellcasters, Korialstrasz would either aid the host from above, raining fire down on the demons, or rally some sort of surprise ally. Both Krasus and Korialstrasz fought valiantly against the likes of [Hakkar the Houndmaster](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hakkar_the_Houndmaster "Hakkar the Houndmaster"), [Mannoroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mannoroth "Mannoroth") the Destructor, [Archimonde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archimonde "Archimonde") the Defiler, [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") the Destroyer, and their twisted former friend and allies, [Neltharion the Earth-Warder](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing") and his [Black Dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_dragonflight "Black dragonflight"). After escaping the [Great Sundering](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Sundering "Great Sundering") of the [Well of Eternity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Well_of_Eternity "Well of Eternity") and the legion's defeat, Krasus and his companions were returned to their own time by Nozdormu.

One hundred years before the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War"), Korialstrasz killed the [Manta](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manta "Manta"), a creature ten times the size and strength of a dragon, with an arrow covered in three drops of a black liquid from a vial.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Second War and after

Prior to the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War"), Korialstrasz assumed the identity of a high elf mage named Krasus, and became one of the senior leaders of the Kirin Tor — the ruling council of the magocratic kingdom of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") alongside [Antonidas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antonidas "Antonidas"), [Prince Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider "Kael'thas Sunstrider") and [Kel'Thuzad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kel%27Thuzad "Kel'Thuzad"). Hardly anyone knew who he really was: Antonidas's apprentice [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") was not one of those privy to the truth.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

He, along with his colleagues, questioned the young mage [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar") on the events that occurred in [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan") some years previous — including the death of [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"), the apparent presence of [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras"), and Khadgar's descriptions of [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

After the Second War, Krasus learned from Antonidas that [orcs](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") riding on black dragons had stolen several ships from the [Menethil Harbor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Menethil_Harbor "Menethil Harbor"). At that moment, the [Arcane Vault](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Vault "Arcane Vault") of Dalaran was destroyed and robbed of its artifact - the [Eye of Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Dalaran "Eye of Dalaran") by death knights. Krasus, Kael and a few others then helped Antonidas in attacking the death knights, however, they escaped with the help of [Deathwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing") and his black dragons.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

### Day of the Dragon

Krasus used his position to his advantage when Alexstrasza was captured by the Horde and held prisoner so that her children would serve the orcish war effort. Korialstrasz continued to fight the battle that his kinsmen had given up long ago; the freeing of the Dragonqueen from the [Dragonmaw clan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonmaw_clan "Dragonmaw clan"). All of that came for nothing though until, at the end of the war, the Kirin Tor sent [Rhonin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rhonin "Rhonin") on an observatory mission to [Khaz Modan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khaz_Modan "Khaz Modan"). Korialstrasz gave Rhonin other orders: to free Alexstrasza. Knowing that [Deathwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing") would surely arrive to kill the Dragonqueen, Korialstrasz attempted to seek out the other three Aspects, [Malygos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malygos "Malygos") in the [Nexus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nexus "Nexus"), [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu"), and [Ysera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ysera "Ysera"), realizing only with their help could the black dragon be defeated. However, their responses held bleak hope for his Queen. Whilst trying to scry into [Lord Prestor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing")'s hovel, he triggered a magical trap known as the [Endless Hunger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Endless_Hunger "Endless Hunger"), and lost the two last fingers on his left hand.

When the final battle at [Grim Batol](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grim_Batol "Grim Batol") began, Korialstrasz assumed dragon form once more and made haste in order to recapture the [Demon Soul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Soul "Demon Soul") from [Nekros Skullcrusher](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nekros_Skullcrusher "Nekros Skullcrusher"). Nekros tried to use the [Demon Soul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Soul "Demon Soul") on him but despite its great power, Korialstrasz was able to break free. Weakened, he dropped to the earth where he summoned Rhonin to him and asked him to do this task. The three [Dragon Aspects](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Aspects "Dragon Aspects") arrived and healed Korialstrasz, then battled Deathwing. The battle took a turn for the worse until Rhonin destroyed the Demon Soul and the Aspects could now attack with their full power. Deathwing was no match for their combined might, and fled. Korialstrasz was reunited with his Queen and, after gathering up her unhatched children, they disappeared off into the night.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Shortly before the Third War, Krasus was present at a banquet held in honor of [Arthas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil") and Kael who at the same time were present in Dalaran.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

### War of the Ancients - present time

Korialstrasz was later called upon by Nozdormu to heal a rift in time. While exploring the time anomaly, Krasus and his former apprentice Rhonin were swallowed by the anomaly and thrown ten thousand years into the past. (See _War of the Ancients_ section above). Upon his return to his own time period, Korialstrasz delivered the [Axe of Cenarius](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Axe_of_Cenarius "Axe of Cenarius") and story of [Broxigar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broxigar "Broxigar") to the Warchief [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall"), then flew off to rejoin Alexstrasza.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

### The Sunwell

[![Comics title.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/98/Comics_title.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/57?cb=20180928143648)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Comics "Comics") **This section concerns content related to the _Warcraft_ [manga](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manga "Manga") or [comics](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Comics "Comics").**

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/ff/Korialstrasz.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20080415154926)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/ff/Korialstrasz.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080415154926)

Korialstrasz in _Ghostlands_.

Korialstrasz originally saw the re-accumulation of the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell")'s energy right after [Kael](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael "Kael") returned to the forsaken homeland and destroyed the tainted [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"),<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and did not want the Lich King's new [death knight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_knight "Death knight"), the treacherous [Prince Arthas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil"), to discover it. Korialstrasz formed the energy into a humanoid shape — the form of a peasant girl named [Anveena Teague](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anveena_Teague "Anveena Teague"). Hiding the truth from her until a later time, Korialstrasz gave Anveena the illusion of having lived a normal life. Though not intentionally, she came to life and gained feelings and emotions all on her own through his masterful illusion.

Years later, Anveena and [Kalec](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalec "Kalec") began searching for a mysterious mage named Borel in order to remove cursed collars. Borel had appeared to [Jorad Mace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jorad_Mace "Jorad Mace") who during the [Third War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Third_War "Third War") wanted to escape the mad Arthas. Having no strength, Borel helped Jorad to survive. Borel's true identity is later revealed - the red dragon Korialstrasz. He began telling Anveena the truth — that she was the avatar of the Sunwell — when [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dar%27Khan_Drathir "Dar'Khan Drathir"), the elf who allowed Arthas into [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)"), intervened and began draining the power from her.

Korialstrasz never meant to intrude upon the events taking place, until Dar'Khan — upon gaining some of the power of the Sunwell he drained from Anveena — took control of the red dragon. Unable to break the mind control, Korialstrasz was forced to do battle with the blue dragon [Tyrygosa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrygosa "Tyrygosa"), until the spell was broken by [Raac](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Raac "Raac"). While the battle against Dar'Khan continued, Korialstrasz had once more stepped to the side to observe all of what transpired. In the end, he said that he would continue to watch over Anveena and Kalec through the eyes of Raac as they stayed in the care of [Lor'themar Theron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron "Lor'themar Theron"), the Regent of Quel'Thalas.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

### World of Warcraft

[![WoW Icon update.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/38/WoW_Icon_update.png/revision/latest?cb=20180602175550)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft") **This section concerns content related to the original _[World of Warcraft](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")_.**

Korialstrasz is mentioned on several occasions:

### Night of the Dragon

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/74/Krasus.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/140?cb=20110604003134)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/74/Krasus.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20110604003134)

Krasus in _Night of the Dragon_.

Seeking something amiss Krasus decides to journey to Grim Batol in order to understand what force was darkening it's halls. En route to his destination he is attacked by a band of [Naga](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naga "Naga") and after dealing with them, he continues his journey in his mortal disguise. In time he would meet the [Draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei") priestess [Iridi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iridi "Iridi") and re-encounter Kalec. At first, Kalec's attitude towards the consort of Alexstrasza was bitter and antagonistic; he blamed Krasus for his constant interference, and particularly for giving Anveena the illusion of life knowing how it would end.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The pair would eventually end up arguing, and Krasus would reveal that he took the time to memorize the lives of everyone he had manipulated. The two dragons would then separate from Iridi as Kalec rushed off and Krasus teleported her away. During the battle that followed the pair would be captured and brought to Grim Batol.

In Grim Batol's halls, Kalec and Krasus discovered the black dragon [Sintharia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sintharia "Sintharia"), now known as Sinestra, creating a new flight of dragons. Working together, oftentimes begrudgingly, the pair were able to escape and working with [Rhonin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rhonin "Rhonin"), [Vereesa Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa_Windrunner "Vereesa Windrunner"), [Rom](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rom "Rom"), the draenei priestess [Iridi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iridi "Iridi"), and the [nether dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_dragon "Nether dragon") [Zzeraku](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zzeraku "Zzeraku"), they overcame Sintharia and her creation, the [twilight dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight_dragonflight "Twilight dragonflight") [Dargonax](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dargonax "Dargonax"). Iridi perished in the final battle, and Kalec took it upon himself to return her body to [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland"). When asked by Krasus if Malygos would allow him to go to Outland, Kalec replied that — permitted or not — he was going anyway; to see Outland once more was Iridi's dying wish, and she deserved to be buried there. Krasus then departed Grim Batol in order to return to his queen.

### Wrath of the Lich King

Korialstrasz finally makes his in-game appearance in _[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King "World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King")_, in the guise of **Krasus**. He is located at the [Wyrmrest Temple](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmrest_Temple "Wyrmrest Temple") in the [Dragonblight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonblight "Dragonblight") at the side of Alexstrasza. Judging from [Nalice](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nalice "Nalice")'s comments in  ![N](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/cb/Neutral_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20110620220434) \[15-30\] [The Obsidian Dragonshrine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Obsidian_Dragonshrine), it was Korialstrasz who called for the dragonflights to come together in the [Wyrmrest Accord](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmrest_Accord "Wyrmrest Accord") to battle Malygos' crusade. He also appears in his natural dragonform with his Queen at [Angrathar the Wrathgate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Angrathar_the_Wrathgate "Angrathar the Wrathgate") following the battle there. Upon players obtaining the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/2/29/Spell_holy_mindsooth.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20180803142917)[\[Key to the Focusing Iris\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Key_to_the_Focusing_Iris_(starter)) from [Sapphiron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphiron_(tactics) "Sapphiron (tactics)") in [Naxxramas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naxxramas "Naxxramas"), Krasus gives the players the quest to defeat Malygos and obtain the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/74/Inv_misc_gem_sapphire_01.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20060919214815)[\[Heart of Magic\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_Magic) from the Eye of Eternity.

In addition, there is a platform known as [Krasus' Landing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krasus%27_Landing "Krasus' Landing") in the rebuilt city of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran"), where the city's flight master is located. As of Krasus death (see below), [Modera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Modera "Archmage Modera") is the last living member of the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War")\-era Kirin Tor high council to appear in World of Warcraft.

### Stormrage

When the [Nightmare](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald_Nightmare "Emerald Nightmare") attacked Azeroth, Korialstrasz was settled down in his mountain sanctum near the place where Dalaran once stood. There, he had nightmares in which he became the source for Deathwing's new Demon Soul. Following the [War Against the Nightmare](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_Against_the_Nightmare "War Against the Nightmare"), Korialstrasz was present for the wedding of [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malfurion_Stormrage "Malfurion Stormrage") and [Tyrande Whisperwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrande_Whisperwind "Tyrande Whisperwind"), as Alexstrasza was performing the ceremony alongside [Ysera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ysera "Ysera").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

### Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects

After the cataclysm, the dragons convened upon Wyrmrest Temple to have their first meeting with the [blue dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragonflight "Blue dragonflight") since the death of Malygos. Korialstrasz, not particularly liked by many of the blues, specifically [Arygos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arygos "Arygos"), chose to stay behind and watch his newest clutch of eggs in the [Ruby Sanctum](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Sanctum "Ruby Sanctum"). As Alexstrasza attended the meeting above, Korialstrasz discovered the [Twilight's Hammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight%27s_Hammer "Twilight's Hammer") within the sanctum, casting dark spells on the eggs. Confronting them, he discovered that their spells had mutated the hatchlings, transforming them into deformed [chromatic dragons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chromatic_dragonflight "Chromatic dragonflight"). When he touched the first mutated hatchling, the infection passed on to him. It was then revealed to him via the gloating by one of the dying cultists that Korialstrasz had crushed that not only was the entire clutch of eggs infected, but _every_ flight's eggs, in each of their sanctums. Slowly mutating into a Chromatic dragon but thinking of his beloved Queen one last time, Korialstrasz summoned every ounce of his life energy to link the portals of all the sanctums together and imploded, destroying a good chunk of Wyrmrest Temple, and utterly obliterating himself and the sanctums. Along with the sanctums fell the thousands of corrupted, hatching eggs. While his death and seeming betrayal was a shock to the other dragonflights, Alexstrasza suffered the most. In sadness bordering on madness, she shattered the Wyrmrest Accord and fled to the center of [Desolace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Desolace "Desolace"), where she sat waiting for death. [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") attempted to rouse her from her depression but could not.

Later, during a battle above Wyrmrest Temple, Thrall had a near-death experience after falling from extraordinary heights. In his vision, given to him by the [Spirit of Life](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_Life "Spirit of Life"), among other things he saw the truth behind Korialstrasz's actions. When the battle had ended, Thrall brought the news to Alexstrasza, who rejoined the fight with renewed purpose to not let her love's sacrifice be in vain. Before fighting [Chromatus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chromatus "Chromatus"), Alexsrasza revealed the truth behind her mate's actions before the other dragonflights in order to clear his name and boost morale in the face of the danger before them.

#### Alternate timeline

A version of [Krasus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz_(alternate_universe) "Korialstrasz (alternate universe)") exists in a [timeway](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_timeline "Alternate timeline") where history turned out completely different and which was entered by [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") right after his death in the main timeline.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

### Tides of War

At some point before his demise, Krasus made the following prophecy and bequeathed it to Rhonin, describing a future leader of the Kirin Tor:

_After the red comes the silver,_  
_She who was golden and bright;_  
_The Proud Lady humbled and bitter,_  
_Shall now turn her thoughts to the fight._

_Saphire to diamond she gleams now,_  
_The Kirin Tor leader who comes,_  
_"Queen" of a kingdom now fallen,_  
_Marching to war's martial drums._

_Be ye warned - the tides of war_  
_At last shall break upon the shore._

The prophecy was fulfilled with the death of Rhonin and the ascendancy of [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"), former ruler of the destroyed city of [Theramore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Theramore_Isle "Theramore Isle"), as leader of the Kirin Tor.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

Korialstrasz, as seen in _[Shadows and Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_and_Light "Shadows and Light")_.

[![Icon-RPG.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/60/Icon-RPG.png/revision/latest?cb=20191213192632)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG "Warcraft RPG") **This section contains information from the [Warcraft RPG](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG "Warcraft RPG") which is considered [non-canon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Non-canon "Non-canon")**.

Korialstrasz is an ancient, wise, and powerful dragon of the [red dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Red_dragonflight "Red dragonflight"). He was Alexstrasza's newest consort just prior to the War of the Ancients and continues to be so to this day. As her current prime consort, Korialstrasz acts as Alexstrasza's majordomo in all affairs. He is fiercely loyal to his queen, and was "first in love" among her consorts. As an active agent of the red dragonflight he is a protector of all things living, often spending time away from his queen and kin for his duties. He constantly watches over the younger races, often taking mortal guises and hiding amongst them. His most prominent guise in recent times is that of **Krasus**, a [high elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf") mage of the Kirin Tor, and a member of the Six; the ruling council of Dalaran. Another guise is that of **Borel**, most likely his alias among the [Convocation of Silvermoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Convocation_of_Silvermoon "Convocation of Silvermoon").<sup><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wowpedia:Citation" title="Wowpedia:Citation">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a></sup> 

Krasus appears to be a high elf wizard of extreme confidence, secure in his power and rank among the council. His very presence commands respect, and yet he is not proud or haughty. He remains in his elven form almost exclusively, transforming into a dragon only for special reasons or when in the presence of others of his kind. Those few who know his true nature have agreed to keep it a secret.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_18-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-ReferenceA-18">[18]</a></sup>

Krasus remains in his elven shape as long as possible during battle, revealing his dragon form only if desperate. He almost never shows his great strength in physical combat, preferring instead to fight with the spells and other arcane powers at his disposal. Should he choose to show his dragon side, he takes to the air swiftly, using his breath weapon and spell-like abilities to speed his escape. For all his strength and power, he is actually quite inexperienced in draconic combat. After all, he’s had little opportunity to practice during his decades of roaming the surface of Azeroth in humanoid form.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_18-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-ReferenceA-18">[18]</a></sup>

## Memorable quotes

### War of the Ancients

-   "Yes, [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malfurion_Stormrage "Malfurion Stormrage"), I am a dragon. A red dragon, to be precise. Long have I worn the form of one mortal creature or another, however, for it has been my choice to walk among you, teaching and learning as I strive for peace among all of us."
-   "The Burning Legion is but a shadow of [his](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") terrible darkness. Trust in me when I say that we have hope even if every demon who serves [him](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") comes through, but _no_ hope if we destroy all only to have him step into the world."
-   "[It's](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Sundering "Great Sundering") begun...May the [creators](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titans "Titans") protect us...it's begun and there's nothing we can do to stop it..."

    **Malfurion**: "There is no need for that."  
    **Korialstrasz**: "So _you_ say. You were not the one dying."
-   **Neltharion**: "You know me...but I do not know you. You would speak against me... make the others see me as you do... you would have them distrust their comrade of old...their brother...You will not be allowed to spread any of your malicious falsehoods..."  
    **Korialstrasz**: "I am one of you! My true name is known to the Queen of Life, but for now I am simply Krasus."  
    **Malygos**: "He bellows well, this hatchling."  
    **Korialstrasz**: "This is not a time for humor, especially for you, Guardian of Magic! This is a time when a balance is nigh upset! A terrible mistake, a distortion of reality, threatens everything...absolutely everything!"  
    **Neltharion**: "How dramatic..."  
    **Korialstrasz**: "You will hear my story! You will hear it and understand...for there is a worse danger on the horizon, one which touches us as well. You see — "  
    **Neltharion**: _"I did warn you..."_

#### [The Sundering](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sundering "The Sundering")

-   "[We](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Red_dragonflight "Red dragonflight") are the servants of Life, which means we know [Death](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancy "Necromancy") equally well."
-   "Rest easy, my friends. I am only resurrecting the memories of his path. He will walk it, then that will be the end of the matter.

-   "I discovered the re-accumulation of the [well](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell")'s energy, but thought it best to hide the truth until better days. I feared the [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King") might claim the power and thus seal the fate of all Azeroth! I believed I created a mere, if masterful, illusion to hide it...but [the illusion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anveena_Teague "Anveena Teague") became life on its own, something I never expected."
-   "To all eyes, even [Arthas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas "Arthas")', this [place](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell_Plateau "Sunwell Plateau") will still be barren. She has such power."

## Notes and trivia

-   With [Rhonin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rhonin "Rhonin")'s death in _[Jaina Proudmoore: Tides of War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore:_Tides_of_War "Jaina Proudmoore: Tides of War")_ and Korialstrasz's dying in _[Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall:_Twilight_of_the_Aspects "Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects")_, none of the time-travelers from the _[War of the Ancients Trilogy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients_Trilogy "War of the Ancients Trilogy")_ are alive.
-   Korialstrasz knows the [Titan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan_(language) "Titan (language)")<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> and [Draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei_(language) "Draenei (language)")<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> languages.
-   Krasus is missing two small fingers of his left hand due to [Daval Prestor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Daval_Prestor "Daval Prestor")'s [Endless Hunger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Endless_Hunger "Endless Hunger") curse. His eyes were black and face covered with scars.
-   Before [Patch 3.1.0](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.1.0 "Patch 3.1.0"), Krasus (Korialstrasz) had a meager 13,000 health in his dragon form. This paled in comparison to the whopping 13.9 million Alexstrasza has and the fact that he is an ?? elite boss. He now has 11,156,000 health.
-   Korialstrasz uses a male high elf voice set in game.
-    ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/46/Inv_misc_coin_19.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20080911133214)[\[Krasus' Copper Coin\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krasus%27_Copper_Coin) can be fished from [Dalaran Fountain](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran_Fountain "Dalaran Fountain").
-   He had the ability to raise corpses.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>
-   Krasus had turned down leadership of the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six") more than once.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
-   Blizzard originally planned for Korialstrasz to be the red dragon who aided players in the battle against [Sinestra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sinestra_(tactics) "Sinestra (tactics)") in the [Bastion of Twilight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bastion_of_Twilight "Bastion of Twilight") and who sacrificed himself to ensure victory. It would've made a lot of sense for Krasus to be present given his history with Sinestra, and since he was an important, recognizable character, his sacrifice would have had meaningful impact. However, Blizzard eventually realized that Krasus was slated to die in the not-yet-released _Twilight of the Aspects_ book, and so they used [Caelestrasz](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Caelestrasz "Caelestrasz") instead.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>
    -   When Deathwing was lamenting the death of Sintharia in _[Night of the Dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_of_the_Dragon "Night of the Dragon")_ it is stated that there would yet be a reckoning with Korialstrasz,<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Korialstrasz#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> potentially hinting at his imminent death caused by Deathwing or his minions.
-   Nozdormu apologizes to Korialstrasz after the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients") for actions he would commit against him in the future and says that not even he can change his ultimate "fate". Although he was apparently not directly responsible, his future version [Murozond](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Murozond "Murozond") was indeed allied with the Old Gods during the [Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm_(event) "Cataclysm (event)"), the latter in fact largely responsible for the creation of the infinite dragonflight.
