**Flesh-shaping** is an extremely painful process which is used on living animals. It "stretches" skin, bone and flesh on animals, forming it into new shapes, while they're alive and screaming loudly. Mastering this power requires decades of study.<sup id="cite_ref-Vol'jin_2-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flesh-shaping#cite_note-Vol'jin-2">[2]</a></sup> The [Engine of Nalak'sha](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Engine_of_Nalak%27sha "Engine of Nalak'sha") was the source of the [mogu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mogu "Mogu")'s flesh-shaping power.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flesh-shaping#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flesh-shaping#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> In the [Halls of Flesh-Shaping](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halls_of_Flesh-Shaping_(subzone) "Halls of Flesh-Shaping (subzone)") lies [the mysterious substance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anima_(blood_fluid) "Anima (blood fluid)") responsible for all [mogu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mogu "Mogu") flesh-shaping experiments.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flesh-shaping#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Upon entering the [Dark Rookery](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Rookery "Dark Rookery"), Vol'jin felt the residue from the creation of the saurok. According to him, the magic that could remake something so completely came from the dawn of time, and the [titans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") had used such magic in their acts of creation. The incredible powers of such sorcery cannot be understood, let alone mastered, by a sound mind, but dreams of it fuels flights of fancy. Vol'jin thought that the same magic that had created the first saurok could unmake the [murlocs](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Murloc "Murloc") that had killed [his father](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sen%27jin "Sen'jin") or cause [humans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") to regress back to [vrykul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vrykul "Vrykul"). However, he also realized that in thinking that, he was falling prey to the same trap as the mogu. Immortal magic will inevitably corrupt a mortal, destroying the wielder and, likely, his people.<sup id="cite_ref-Vol'jin_2-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flesh-shaping#cite_note-Vol'jin-2">[2]</a></sup>
