“We must put the Nightwell behind us. We must take responsibility for our failings, and repay our debt to the people of xref:Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth]....”

— [First Arcanist Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_Arcanist_Thalyssra "First Arcanist Thalyssra"), the new ruler of [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar"), allowing the Nightwell to perish

The **Nightwell** is a font of incredible power<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> created by the [Highborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Highborne "Highborne"). The convergence of [ley lines](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ley_line "Ley line") is what feeds its great power.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The fount was created and is sustained through the [Eye of Aman'thul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul "Eye of Aman'thul"), one of the [Pillars of Creation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation "Pillars of Creation"). Similar to the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"), it permeates and empowers the elves who dwell in its vicinity. [Arcwine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcwine "Arcwine") is the method by which the [Nightborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne "Nightborne") imbibe the Nightwell's energies, and the palace rations it to control the populace.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Being unable to feed off the Nightwell's energies causes heavy withdrawal symptoms. Banishment from [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar") is thus the harshest punishment in nightborne society, as exiles are cut off from the Nightwell's power and faced with degeneration, first into [nightfallen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightfallen "Nightfallen"), and in time into a [withered](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Withered "Withered") state, a point of no return.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> According to [Arcanist Valtrois](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanist_Valtrois "Arcanist Valtrois"), the Nightwell's power rivaled even that of the [Well of Eternity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Well_of_Eternity "Well of Eternity").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

After the defeat of [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)") atop the [Nighthold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nighthold "Nighthold"), the [Eye of Aman'thul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul "Eye of Aman'thul") was secured by the Kirin Tor. Without it, the well became unstable. Valtrois suggested attempting to stabilize it, even though the nightborne no longer needed it to sustain themselves, so that they could use its power, but [First Arcanist Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_Arcanist_Thalyssra "First Arcanist Thalyssra") believed it was best for the nightborne people to leave it behind them and let it die, a decision met with approval by both [Tyrande Whisperwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrande_Whisperwind "Tyrande Whisperwind") and [Lady Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin"), who believed that Nightwell's power and allure would fade, with time.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

## History

When the city faced starvation, this source of power would become more than a font for magical spells and works, it would become the principal source of nourishment in place of the exhausted food supplies.<sup><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wowpedia:Citation" title="Wowpedia:Citation">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a></sup>  Crimes in the city were punished by exile, and thus those exiled would suffer the horrible fate. The effects manifest as immense pain and hungering need to feed off Arcane energy. Exile would deny any access to [Arcwine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcwine "Arcwine") resulting in starvation, deterioration, and, after a period of time, to the mindless Nightfallen second stage of [Withered](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Withered "Withered").

The Nightwell is the [Nightborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne "Nightborne") elves' great source of power, and through it they have been able to meet the majority of their essential needs and maintain a refuge, shielded and hidden from the rest of the world they believed was overrun by demons. The energies of the Nightwell would alter their night elven forms further, becoming more slender and darker toned than previous, and causing the well would to be a necessary source of nourishment.

The fruit of the [Arcan'dor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcan%27dor "Arcan'dor") frees the Nightborne of this addiction, even allowing Nightfallen to return to their previous states. After this discovery, Thalyssra begins to hand out the fruit to those she can, freeing her people of their terrible curse. Ultimately, with the Arcan'dor at their disposal, Thalyssra becomes the new leader of the Nightborne after Elisande's defeat in the Nighthold. She uses it to remove the addiction, and allows the Nightwell to burn out, as it had began to dwindle without the [Eye of Aman'thul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul "Eye of Aman'thul"), which had been brought to Dalaran.

## Notes

-   Unlike how all [high elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf") were addicted to the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"), nightborne were dependent on the Nightwell as a source of nourishment.
-   Before the creation of the Nightwell, the [night elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf") of [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar_City "Suramar City") used a system of tunnels called the [Arcway](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcway "Arcway") that contained arcane coils which tapped into the [ley lines](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ley_line "Ley line") beneath the region.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> This fell out of use with the Nightwell's creation.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
-   The [nightborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne "Nightborne") only learned of the horrible nightfallen [withered](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Withered "Withered") fate that awaited exiles after the shield came down.<sup><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wowpedia:Citation" title="Wowpedia:Citation">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a></sup>  It is possible that until that point the effect of the Nightwell and possibly its nature was unknown as exiles never returned.
-   [Essence](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Essence_of_Aman%27Thul "Essence of Aman'Thul") of [Aman'Thul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aman%27Thul "Aman'Thul")'s power now dwells within the inhabitants of the Nighthold after centuries in close proximity with the Eye.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> When tapping into the Well, the people of Suramar tapped into the energies of the titan himself.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

-   It is highly possible that the Nightwell, like the Well of Eternity, is formed from the very lifeblood of Azeroth's world-soul.  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/81/Inv_knife_1h_artifactcthun_d_01.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20151208214717)[\[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xal%27atath,_Blade_of_the_Black_Empire) noted as the player entered Suramar: "Suramar, its "noble" citizens greedily slurping at their world's very lifeblood."<sup id="cite_ref-SuramarWhispers_12-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-SuramarWhispers-12">[12]</a></sup> This is the same terminology used in [Chronicle Volume 1](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chronicle_Volume_1 "Chronicle Volume 1") to describe the [Well of Eternity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Well_of_Eternity "Well of Eternity") ("the lifeblood of Azeroth's world-soul").<sup id="cite_ref-Chronicle36_13-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell#cite_note-Chronicle36-13">[13]</a></sup>
-   The Nightwell seems to operate like a giant leyline feed of the Arcway, drawing energies from the deepest ley lines below the city. The color of the Nightwell and the nightborne is a much darker violet than normal arcane sources, the well is noted multiple times as being corrupting (including [trapping nearly souls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nighthold:_Wailing_In_The_Night "The Nighthold: Wailing In The Night")), and strange shadows appear on the floor next to the [Manaflush Nobles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manaflush_Noble "Manaflush Noble"). In _Chronicle Volume 1_, the future site of Suramar is located just north of the prison of [N'Zoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/N%27Zoth "N'Zoth") and is definitely within its territory. It is possible that the Eye of Aman'thul bored into a part of N'Zoth's body, or near enough to it for it to have some influence on the Nightwell.
