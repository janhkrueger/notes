He used to lead the sin'dorei in the absence of [Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider "Kael'thas Sunstrider"), but after his betrayal and eventual death, Lor'themar became the sole leader of his people. Lor'themar was once the second-in-command to [Ranger General Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"), and assumed temporary leadership of the [high elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf") after the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") onslaught, a role that would pave the way to his regency after the prince's return.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

After surviving the brutal [Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Scourge_invasion_of_Quel%27Thalas "The Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas"), Lor'themar, a former commander of the [Farstriders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders"), was entrusted with watching over the elven kingdom while Prince Kael'thas journeyed to [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland"). Not long afterward, Lor'themar's will was tested when the prince, twisted by [demonic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon "Demon") energies, returned to Azeroth and attempted to use the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") to summon his new master, the [demon lord](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_lord "Demon lord") [Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden "Kil'jaeden"). Kael'thas' plans were foiled and he was killed by the [Shattered Sun Offensive](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattered_Sun_Offensive "Shattered Sun Offensive") for his treachery, leaving Lor'themar to guide the fate of the blood elves alone. With the Sunwell reborn, a bright future now lies ahead for Quel'Thalas.

Lor'themar, who had weathered many of the kingdom's darkest days, now leads his people toward their new destiny.<sup id="cite_ref-us.battle.net_11-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-us.battle.net-11">[11]</a></sup> In light of [Garrosh Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh_Hellscream "Garrosh Hellscream")'s then-increasing paranoia and lack of scruples, the Regent Lord had aligned himself with the growing [Darkspear Rebellion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_Rebellion "Darkspear Rebellion") to overthrow the Warchief after dealing with the [Thunder King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lei_Shen "Lei Shen")'s return. Lor'themar pledged his loyalty to the new [Warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warchief "Warchief") [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") following the [Siege of Orgrimmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Orgrimmar "Siege of Orgrimmar"). Following the disastrous [Battle for Broken Shore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_Broken_Shore "Battle for Broken Shore"), Lor'themar was among those present when Vol'jin named Sylvanas Windrunner the new Warchief with his dying breath. Windrunner's tenure as Warchief was ultimately tumultuous, with Lor'themar concerned for the direction she was leading the Horde. He eventually stood alongside other leaders in rebellion against her, and when she deserted the Horde following the death of [Varok Saurfang](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varok_Saurfang "Varok Saurfang"), Lor'themar helped pick up the pieces of the faction. He ultimately became a member of the [Horde Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council"), which was formed to replace the [warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warchief "Warchief") position, representing the blood elves.

## Biography

### Background

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3c/Lor%27themarfarstrider.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20201210134246)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3c/Lor%27themarfarstrider.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201210134246)

Lor'themar, a [high elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf") [Farstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider "Farstrider") and warden of the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell").

As a [Farstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider "Farstrider") [lieutenant](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lieutenant "Lieutenant"), Lor'themar Theron frequently clashed with the [Amani](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Amani_tribe "Amani tribe") [trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Forest_troll "Forest troll") of [Zul'Aman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Aman "Zul'Aman"). On one such outing, his three-man-party was ambushed and attacked by Amani raiders, and Theron was brought into a sacrificial chamber. Here, he met the elves [Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin"), [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dar%27Khan_Drathir "Dar'Khan Drathir"), and [Galell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galell "Galell"), and the four attempted to free themselves before the torture began. The Amani chieftain [Zul'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27jin "Zul'jin") himself confronted them and planned to interrogate them over the elven [runestones](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Runestone "Runestone") scattered around the land. Zul'jin personally submitted Lor'themar to a gruesome torture, slicing him below the navel and thrusting his fingers into the wound, then painting his face with Theron's blood. After a struggle, Lor'themar freed himself from his bonds, and fought off the trolls long enough for a replenished Dar'Khan to warp the group to safety.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

Lor'themar served under [Lireesa Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lireesa_Windrunner "Lireesa Windrunner"), [Ranger-general of Silvermoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger-general_of_Silvermoon "Ranger-general of Silvermoon"), whom he respected deeply. Lor'themar often upheld her duties when the Farstriders' ranger-general was absent.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> He was close friends with [Halduron Brightwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing") and Lireesa's middle child, [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"); the three constant companions were known as "the Trio": pensive Lor'themar, merry Halduron, and mischievous Sylvanas.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

When his ranger-general was slain in Lordaeron, Lor'themar and several Farstriders departed to investigate. As the highest-ranking Farstrider besides Sylvanas herself, it fell to Lor'themar to formally anoint Lireesa's chosen successor as their new ranger-general. At [Farstrider Retreat](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider_Retreat "Farstrider Retreat"), he led the rangers in a eulogy to their fallen leader and a pledge to acknowledge Sylvanas as their new one.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

Lor'themar opposed Sylvanas' induction of [Nathanos Marris](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathanos_Marris "Nathanos Marris") into the Farstriders. He, Halduron, and other high elves had never warmed to their ranger-general's "human pet", and though they'd fought as comrades – Marris had even saved Theron's life upon their first encounter – Lor'themar did not consider doing one's duty an act worthy of exceptional treatment. Their concern was not purely born of prejudice: the Farstriders had already been splintered by Alleria's abdication and departure to join the Alliance, and Sylvanas' friends worried the appointment would fuel slanderous rumours that might imperil her position at court.

Lor'themar rose steadily through the Farstriders' ranks over the years. He was made a ranger captain some time before the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War"),<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup> became [Ranger General](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger-general_of_Silvermoon "Ranger-general of Silvermoon") [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner")'s second-in-command, and spent at least part of his career as a warden of the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell").<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

### Second War

In the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War"), Lor'themar was second-in-command to [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"), [Ranger-General of Silvermoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger-General_of_Silvermoon "Ranger-General of Silvermoon").<sup id="cite_ref-bctownhall_ch4_17-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-bctownhall_ch4-17">[17]</a></sup> Lor'themar joined his brethren in the battle against the invading [Old Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Horde "Old Horde") forces after [King Anasterian Sunstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anasterian_Sunstrider "Anasterian Sunstrider") resolved to crush the [Amani](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Amani "Amani") once and for all. Lor'themar, his armor coated in the blood of his enemies, met with [Alleria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria "Alleria") and [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") during an aerial invasion by the [Dragonmaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonmaw "Dragonmaw") and their subdued [red dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Red_dragon "Red dragon") mounts. Alleria introduced him as one of the elves' finest rangers, and Theron and Turalyon, who shared the rank of second-in-command to the military leader of their respective races, developed a mutual respect during the conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

Lor'themar noted that he and his warriors had managed to escape the inferno wrought on by the rampant red dragons, but that they cannot breach the flames to save their people just yet. Though Alleria favored fighting on in spite of the unfavorable odds, Lor'themar was able to convince her that retreat was the wiser option. Lor'themar then accompanied [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar"), Turalyon, Alleria, and [Kurdran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kurdran "Kurdran") to [Capital City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_City "Capital City"), and fought in its defense. The capital was under siege by [Orgrim Doomhammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrim_Doomhammer "Orgrim Doomhammer"), though Doomhammer quickly abandoned this battle upon learning of great treachery at the hands of his chief [warlock](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock "Warlock"), [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan "Gul'dan").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> While Theron and Alleria battled in Lordaeron, the elves in Quel'Thalas sortied troops to destroy the Amani for good. Zul'jin was captured in the chaos by Lor'themar's close friend and comrade, [Halduron Brightwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing"), in whose custody the Amani chieftain was tortured mercilessly. Halduron had intended to drag him back to Silvermoon so that Lor'themar could decide his fate, but Zul'jin escaped during an Amani raid and fled into hiding.<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup>

Following the Second War, Lor'themar was promoted to the rank of ranger lord (_Alar'annalas_ in [Thalassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalassian "Thalassian")) by [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner") in a grand ceremony and draped with the Fora'nal cloth to symbolize his progression. He was congratulated by King Anasterian Sunstrider himself.<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup>

### Third War

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/88/Theron_Sunwell_Isle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130211231051)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/88/Theron_Sunwell_Isle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130211231051)

Lor'themar fights his way to the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") during the Scourge invasion of [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)").

Years later, following [King Anasterian's](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/King_Anasterian "King Anasterian") secession of [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)") from the Alliance, Lor'themar had become a chief commander of the [Farstriders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders") — specifically, tasked with watching over the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") and safeguarding those who, in turn, would watch over all of Quel'Thalas. During this time, Lor'themar was approached by [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dar%27Khan_Drathir "Dar'Khan Drathir"), a disillusioned face from the past who craved the recognition he felt he had never received.

Dar'Khan used his friendship with Lor'themar to gain intimate knowledge of Quel'Thalas' defenses, ostensibly to bolster them after the Hordes invasion during the Second War, and informed the [death knight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_knight "Death knight") and scion of Lordaeron, the evil Prince [Arthas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas "Arthas") (whom Dar'Khan had sold his loyalty to), of how to bypass them. Lor'themar and his company had been patrolling near the mountains of [Zul'Aman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Aman "Zul'Aman")<sup id="cite_ref-UVG_5-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-UVG-5">[5]</a></sup> when he began to notice hints of an [invasion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Scourge_invasion_of_Quel%27Thalas "The Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas"). They rushed to [An'owyn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/An%27owyn "An'owyn"), whose invisibility had been dispelled and whose hidden mooncrystal—one of three which empowered the grand shield, [Ban'dinoriel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ban%27dinoriel "Ban'dinoriel") ("Gatekeeper" in Thalassian), around Silvermoon—had been stolen. Lor'themar, reasoning that even if the crystals had been displaced, the magi could still empower Ban'dinoriel themselves, made haste to [An'daroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/An%27daroth "An'daroth"), the second resting place of the mooncrystals. It became gradually apparent to Lor'themar that treachery was at work, but with the kingdom in imminent danger, he had little time to speculate on it.

At An'daroth, only corpses and strangely decayed ground remained. To Lor'themar's disbelief, the dead were reanimated and butchered many of his rangers. Lor'themar deduced that decapitation would fell the risen elves, and dealt with several in such a manner, though his wounds and fatigue slowed him down. After a struggle, Lor'themar was brutalized by several undead guardians, one of whom raked his face and damaged his left eye. Forcing the ranger lord down, the undead prepared to deal Lor'themar killing blows, though [Halduron Brightwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing") and his rangers arrived and fettered the risen guardians with arrows. Theron and Brightwing then rushed back to the capital, hoping it was not too late.<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup>

Despite Lor'themar's belief that the situation could still be salvaged, it was already too late. The [Ranger Corps](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_Corps "Ranger Corps") fought Arthas at every turn, but were pushed further and further back towards their capital.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Sylvanas Windrunner was slain by Arthas outside Silvermoon, the city was sacked,<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> and [King Anasterian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anasterian_Sunstrider "Anasterian Sunstrider") and the entire [Convocation of Silvermoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Convocation_of_Silvermoon "Convocation of Silvermoon") were also slain. Theron fought his way to the [Isle of Quel'Danas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Isle_of_Quel%27Danas "Isle of Quel'Danas"), but the well had already been defiled by Arthas.<sup id="cite_ref-UVG_5-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-UVG-5">[5]</a></sup>

With the deaths of Anasterian, the Convocation, [Grand Magister Belo'vir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister_Belo%27vir "Grand Magister Belo'vir"), and Sylvanas, Lor'themar assumed temporary leadership of the high elves and, along with his much-reduced forces, remained in Quel'Thalas after the fall of Silvermoon as a resistance to the Scourge remnants.<sup id="cite_ref-bctownhall_ch4_17-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-bctownhall_ch4-17">[17]</a></sup> Lor'themar reclaimed [The Bazaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bazaar "The Bazaar") from the Scourge, and made it a makeshift base for any elven survivors he could find. Soon after, [Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider "Kael'thas Sunstrider") returned to his homeland, and surveyed the damage done to his kingdom. He sent the archmage [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath") to confer with Lor'themar, and to prepare for his arrival. Lor'themar showed the prince to the body of his father and was present when the king was cremated on a funeral pyre. Lor'themar accompanied Kael, Rommath, Halduron, Liadrin, and several others to [Quel'Danas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Danas "Quel'Danas") once more, to destroy the tainted [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") before the Amani could seize it.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/6c/Lor%27themar_heritage_flashback.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20181025232512)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/6c/Lor%27themar_heritage_flashback.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181025232512)

Lor'themar when Prince Kael'thas destroyed the corrupted Sunwell.

The group returned triumphantly to Silvermoon, freed from the threat of the Sunwell's corrupted state, though the loss of the Sunwell led to a withdrawal-based lethargy for the survivors, who had become dependent on the well's arcane energy.

### The Sunwell

Lor'themar, [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron") and the [Farstriders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders") intercept xref:Kalecgos.adoc[Kalecgos] and his companions.

After the xref:ThirdWar.adoc[Third War], the traitor [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dar%27Khan_Drathir "Dar'Khan Drathir") pursued [Anveena Teague](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anveena_Teague "Anveena Teague"), the current avatar of the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"), into Quel'Thalas. Leading a group of blood elf rangers and employing guerilla tactics against the Scourge forces, Lor'themar, along with his close friend [Halduron Brightwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing"), sought to relieve his ravaged and shattered homeland from the Scourge's grasp. After a skirmish, Lor'themar orders his fallen comrades to be burned — to ensure they are not re-animated. Lor'themar learns of Dar'Khan's presence in Quel'Thalas, and in a conversation with Halduron, explains his history with Quel'Thalas' greatest traitor.

Following Dar'Khan's betrayal, Lor'themar had fought desperately to protect the sight of the Sunwell; and though he survived the onslaught of the Scourge, he personally observed the annihilated sight of the once glorious font of power. That day, he resolved to protect the remains of Quel'Thalas from being further tainted by the Scourge, and especially by Dar'Khan. Lor'themar rallies his rangers, and they leave to destroy the treacherous Dar'Khan.

Lor'themar observes Dar'Khan speaking with Anveena. Lor'themar arranges an ambush, and his forces encircle Dar'Khan; though the great traitor summons the skeletons of fallen high elves to protect himself. Lor'themar and his rangers are overpowered, and are forced to retreat. During the march back to safety, Lor'themar is shocked to hear a voice echoing loudly in the distance, which he identifies as belonging to his former ranger-general — the [banshee](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Banshee "Banshee") Queen, [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"). Lor'themar approaches xref:Kalecgos.adoc[Kalecgos] and his companions, suggesting the outsiders drop their weapons and surrender to him. Lor'themar offers them but one chance to live — to inform him of Sylvanas' location. Kalecgos reveals Anveena's current predicament to Lor'themar, and that Dar'Khan is as much their enemy as he is his.

Though Lor'themar is apprehensive to trust the word of a half-blood, Kalecgos states that he is no such thing — but in fact, a [blue dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragon "Blue dragon"), albeit currently without the ability to transform. Lor'themar and Halduron are amused by such an unlikely story, and Lor'themar mockingly notes that they might actually believe him if he could prove it. At that point, [Tyrigosa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrigosa "Tyrigosa") reveals her dragon form to the shocked blood elves. Stunned, Lor'themar drops to one knee, and apologizes for his disrespect.

Lor'themar converses with his new companions and reveals to them the history behind Sylvanas Windrunner's demise. Unsure as to whether the banshee would be friend or foe, they at least acknowledge that she would forever be an enemy of Dar'Khan. The group travels to the [Sunwell Grove](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell_Grove "Sunwell Grove"), and Kalecgos reveals that Anveena is, in fact, the mortal avatar of the Sunwell itself. Lor'themar splits with the group after this and joins with Halduron and company while Kalecgos deals with Dar'Khan. Lor'themar takes to the field once more to attack Dar'Khan, though the traitor chides him for his consistent failures and turns his attention to Kalecgos. Anveena herself is able to awaken and annihilates Dar'Khan with the great power of the Sunwell.

In the wake of Dar'Khan's defeat and the revelations surrounding Anveena by Korialstrasz, Lor'themar placed her under the protection of the blood elves — her true identity to be kept a closely guarded secret.<sup id="cite_ref-GhostlandsManga_24-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-GhostlandsManga-24">[24]</a></sup>

### Reclaiming Quel'Thalas

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/aa/Lorthemar.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20071201214114)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/aa/Lorthemar.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20071201214114)

Lor'themar Theron battles the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge").

After Kael'thas' abandonment of the Alliance resistance, Kael'thas had traveled to [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland") to claim a new home for his people, taking 15% of the sin'dorei with him.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyclopedia_25-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Encyclopedia-25">[25]</a></sup> Kael'thas, however, had not forgotten his people on Azeroth: [Grand Magister Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister_Rommath "Grand Magister Rommath") and a number of [magisters](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magisters "Magisters") were sent back to Quel'Thalas, arriving with orders from the blood elven scion - Lor'themar was to protect Quel'Thalas in Kael'thas' stead, and prepare their people to join the prince in the promised haven of Outland.<sup id="cite_ref-bctownhall_ch5_23-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-bctownhall_ch5-23">[23]</a></sup> Rommath also brought word of a new method to sate magical addiction, and to become more formidable as a result, smoothly attributing it to being one of Kael'thas' teachings. This process was the harvesting of arcane magic, including the mana-bearing creatures maddened since the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell")'s destruction.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyclopedia_25-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Encyclopedia-25">[25]</a></sup> The elves of Quel'Thalas generally took well to this efficient method, though a minority did not.

As the highest figure of authority in Quel'Thalas, ruling conjointly with his scion in Outland, Lor'themar was forced to exile several of his former comrades who refused to accept Rommath's teachings, reasoning that he could not lead a nation divided. This decision would come to weigh him down deeply, during the tribulations to come.<sup id="cite_ref-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun_7-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun-7">[7]</a></sup>

The Scourge threats that Lor'themar and his rangers had harsh troubles with proved little match for Rommath and the magisters, who quickly went about reclaiming and rebuilding [Silvermoon City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silvermoon_City "Silvermoon City") "almost overnight." Ruling as the Regent of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar presided over the much-restored city of Silvermoon. Lor'themar was assisted in this daunting task by his two primary advisors: his good friend [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron") and the prince's most loyal advocate, [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath").

Lor'themar was horrified by the fate that befell Sylvanas Windrunner; unaware of her break from the Scourge, he considered the monster wearing her face nothing but the Lich King's cruel instrument, and hoped the ranger-general their people had loved so well had found peace in death. Overhearing this, Sylvanas – who had returned to Quel'Thalas in the hope of reuniting with her people upon recovering her corpse – knew she would find no acceptance among her living brethren, at least not as the leader and friend she'd once been.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> When Sylvanas revealed herself to Lor'themar, it would be as leader of the [free-willed undead](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Forsaken "Forsaken"). And though she would call her offered aid a gesture of love for her homeland, an equal motivator would be the recruitment of yet more vengeful souls to further her vendetta against the Lich King.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

### Blood of the Highborne

Lor'themar remained in infrequent contact with [Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Liadrin "Liadrin") over the next few years. He made sure she was supplied with enough [mana crystals](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mana_crystal "Mana crystal") to sate her arcane hunger (the rangers were not as affected by the onset of magical addiction as much as more magically-inclined elves), and while initially skeptical of the creation of the [Blood Knight Order](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Knight "Blood Knight"), Lor'themar believed they would overcome their critics and prove a valuable asset to Quel'Thalas. Around that time, Theron began thinking about negotiating with the Horde. Liadrin once visited him and she noticed letters with the Horde seal.

The switch in lifestyle from that of a ranger to a politician was a daunting one for Lor'themar, who would never truly eschew the passion he had for his old life, and continuing to think of himself as a Farstrider on some level.<sup id="cite_ref-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun_7-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun-7">[7]</a></sup> His close friendship with Halduron helped him greatly in this regard, acknowledging his ranger-general as his closest and most loyal ally through this turbulent time in history.<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup>

Lor'themar was troubled by the emergence of a figure named Thadirr, and quickly deduced his true identity: Dar'Khan _Drathir_, thought destroyed by Anveena, but still active and plotting to subvert Quel'Thalas for the Lich King. The traitor had lured the Blood Knights into a trap at [Dawnstar Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dawnstar_Spire "Dawnstar Spire"). Theron and [Astalor Bloodsworn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Astalor_Bloodsworn "Astalor Bloodsworn") arrived to aid them, joining forces with Halduron and the rangers. Lor'themar confronted Dar'Khan personally, though was set ablaze and left to die. The combined healing of the Blood Knights revitalized him, and Lor'themar, arming his bow with a fragment of the Stone of Sparks, loosed at Dar'Khan and "killed" him once more. Noticing Liadrin was not present, Lor'themar left to find her, tracking her to the old troll den they had been held captive in so many years before. There, he found her distraught over the near-wretched corpse of Galell, whom Liadrin was forced to slay.<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup>

### The Burning Crusade

#### New allegiances

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/14/Lor%27themarspire.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20200321140119)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/14/Lor%27themarspire.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200321140119)

Lor'themar, [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath") and [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron") preside over [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas "Quel'Thalas") from [Sunfury Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunfury_Spire "Sunfury Spire").

Leading the blood elves conjointly with Prince Kael'thas, Lor'themar watched over [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)") as its regent. However, Quel'Thalas was still in turmoil, and Lor'themar had few resources to protect the kingdom: its military was still in tatters, the [Amani](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Amani "Amani") had been making bolder strikes in the south, and the emergence of the [Wretched](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wretched "Wretched") had further weakened the elves. To make matters worse, Kael'thas had still not returned from Outland, and the latest news Lor'themar heard of his prince did not bode well. Kael'thas had suffered [considerable defections](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scryers "Scryers") from within his ranks, and the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") was amassing for reasons unknown. The prince was vulnerable, but Lor'themar could not leave Quel'Thalas undefended while he led a campaign to assist Kael'thas on Outland.<sup id="cite_ref-Warcraft_pg._150_28-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Warcraft_pg._150-28">[28]</a></sup>

The blood elves needed allies, and they would no longer find them among the humans, dwarves, gnomes, and night elves. Kael'thas' alliance with [Lady Vashj](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Vashj "Lady Vashj") and [Illidan Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage "Illidan Stormrage") had soured relations between Quel'Thalas and the Alliance, and the kingdom's secession during Anasterian's rule still left bitter memories; the Alliance had no interest in fighting for Quel'Thalas,<sup id="cite_ref-WCE_BE_29-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-WCE_BE-29">[29]</a></sup> to the point that their [ambassador](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prospector_Anvilward "Prospector Anvilward") was actively working with several [night elven spies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sentinel_spies "Sentinel spies") to sabotage the blood elves' arcane sanctums.

The blood elves were offered support from an unlikely source: the [Forsaken](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Forsaken "Forsaken"), under the former ranger-general [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"). Though initially skeptical of a trick, the blood elves allowed the Forsaken to assist them in terms of manpower in the [Ghostlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghostlands "Ghostlands"). Through the Forsaken, Lor'themar was introduced to the wider xref:Horde.adoc[Horde]. Rumors circulated that some lingering part of her still sympathized with Quel'Thalas and its hardships. Other stories hinted that Sylvanas had ulterior motives. Whatever the truth, she arranged for Warchief [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") and High Chieftain [Cairne Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof "Cairne Bloodhoof") to convene with Lor'themar and discuss such a possibility. Despite the elves' history of bitter warfare with the orcs, Lor'themar was receptive to the idea. He knew this Horde was different than the one that had ravaged Quel'Thalas in years past. He was also painfully aware that time was running out for his kingdom and his prince. The Horde's leaders also saw great promise in Lor'themar's people and considered it an act of honor to offer another race facing extinction their support. Thrall and Cairne extended the hand of peace, and Lor'themar accepted.<sup id="cite_ref-Warcraft_pg._150_28-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Warcraft_pg._150-28">[28]</a></sup>

Though thought destroyed, [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dar%27Khan_Drathir "Dar'Khan Drathir") once again managed to elude death, and again he had intentions to steal the power of the Sunwell.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> [Magister Kaendris](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magister_Kaendris "Magister Kaendris") sent troops to defeat Dar'Khan and sent the great traitor's head to Lor'themar. Pleased with this turn of events, and confident that a major [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") defeat in the [Ghostlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghostlands "Ghostlands") would prove the sin'dorei's power to their critics, Lor'themar sent a letter to [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") in which he requested an equal seat with the rest of the Horde. With the strong endorsement of Sylvanas, and revealing to the [Warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warchief "Warchief") that [Silvermoon's Grand Magister](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister_Rommath "Grand Magister Rommath") had received word back from [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland") about what is hinted to of a [clan of uncorrupted orcs](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mag%27har_orc "Mag'har orc"), Thrall officially accepted the sin'dorei into the Horde.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

#### The fallen sun

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/70/Lorthemar.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20100104070648)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/70/Lorthemar.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100104070648)

Lor'themar in his original attire.

The Sunwell's mortal avatar, Anveena Teague, continued to reside in Quel'Thalas under Lor'themar's protection. Only Lor'themar himself and a handful of others were aware of her presence and of what she truly was; they'd kept this information a secret even from Kael'thas. Lor'themar and his followers understood that the prince was desperate to save their people, but feared that if Kael'thas learned of Anveena, he might act without considering the consequences. The elves did not know what would happen if the avatar's power was infused into the site of the Sunwell. Quel'Thalas was already a wounded nation, and another disaster might destroy it forever.

Over time, however, Lor'themar's opinion about this secrecy changed. He and his people constantly worried about Kael'thas's fate on Outland, and Lor'themar knew it was time for him to come home. Lor'themar believed the only way to bring him back was by telling him about Anveena. After Kael'thas had dispatched M'uru to Azeroth, messengers from Lor'themar set out to inform the prince about Anveena—but they never reached him. Demonic agents of [Kil'jaeden the Deceiver](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden_the_Deceiver "Kil'jaeden the Deceiver") had infiltrated Quel'Thalas' highest circles and made sure that no word of Anveena reached Kael'thas. The prospect of restoring the Sunwell would give Kael'thas hope, and that was not what the demon lord needed. He wanted the prince to be desperate and uncertain about the future until he was firmly under control.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

With the Horde's support, the blood elves were able to reach Outland, but what awaited them was not the paradise Kael'thas had promised. In [Shattrath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath "Shattrath"), some learned of their prince's fate: Kael'thas had fallen into despair and a damning addiction to [fel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fel "Fel") magic while sojourning on the shattered planet, and had betrayed Illidan in favor of Kil'jaeden, lord of the Burning Legion, who had targeted Kael'thas for a specific purpose: access to the Sunwell. The [Scryers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scryers "Scryers") worked tirelessly to prove that in allying with the demons the prince had betrayed them all, but some blood elves did not believe these stories. It was not until gathering in [Netherstorm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Netherstorm "Netherstorm") that they saw the truth for themselves.

Word of this discovery reached Lor'themar and the other ranking elves in Quel'Thalas. The news broke their hearts, but they came to a consensus. Kael'thas was lost, and it was their duty to vanquish him and end his treachery. The Horde made war on Kael'thas and his followers, the battle spreading into [Tempest Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tempest_Keep "Tempest Keep") and engulfing every corner of the dimensional fortress. It was there where the prince made his final stand. It was there where some of his own loyal subjects spilled his blood and ended his reign. Yet unbeknownst to the Horde, Kael'thas did not die. Kil'jaeden had expected the prince's defeat, and he had prepared accordingly. Kael'thas's demonic allies spirited him away and brought him back from the brink of death, leaving little of his sanity. He was now Kil'jaeden's loyal servant, and he would do whatever his master asked of him. As the war on Outland reached a climax, Kael'thas finally journeyed home to Quel'Thalas, but it was not the homecoming Lor'themar had hoped for: his prince returned at the head of a demonic army, kidnapped Anveena, briefly assaulted Silvermoon itself with his [felblood elves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felblood_elf "Felblood elf") to kidnap M'uru, and entrenched his forces on the [Isle of Quel'Danas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Isle_of_Quel%27Danas "Isle of Quel'Danas").<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

#### Fury of the Sunwell

Kael'thas, twisted by demonic energies, used the vast arcane resources he'd acquired on Outland to revitalize the Sunwell. Leeching Anveena's power, the well would be transformed into a gateway through which Kil'jaeden could at last enter Azeroth. Lor'themar told his people that they would endure despite the betrayal of Kael'thas, and that like [Arthas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas "Arthas") before him, Kael'thas would not crush the spirit of the sin'dorei.

After a bitter battle, Kael'thas was slain and Kil'jaeden was banished back through his would-be portal. The world was spared from the Legion once more, but there were consequences: Kael'thas's meddling had tainted the Sunwell. As before, corruptive energies coursed through the fount, and they would soon spread throughout Quel'Thalas and engulf the blood elves. Lor'themar and his followers considered destroying the Sunwell again, but another solution presented itself. The [draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei") prophet, [Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Velen "Velen"), had come to the Sunwell to pay his respects to M'uru, who had fallen in the battle. Little was left of the naaru save its heart, but Velen sensed a glimmer of power in what remained of M'uru. He used the naaru's heart to cleanse the Sunwell and transform it into a fount of Holy Light and arcane magic. Its brilliant energy blazed across land and sky for all in Quel'Thalas to see. The Sunwell was reborn, and its return heralded a promising future for the blood elves.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Lor'themar personally gazed upon the restored Sunwell after its revitalization, and despite being shocked to the core, could not help but "feel nothing" in the face of the sole leadership role that now lay ahead for him, his scion branded a traitor and his people turning to him for answers in Kael'thas' stead.<sup id="cite_ref-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun_7-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun-7">[7]</a></sup>

The sin'dorei have generally accepted Lor'themar's rule in the absence of surviving royalty, and the [blood elven sentries](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Guardian "Arcane Guardian") that had once announced that Kael'thas would lead them to power and glory now speak of Lor'themar fulfilling this role.

With the death of Prince Kael'thas, and no surviving members of the [Sunstrider dynasty](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunstrider_dynasty "Sunstrider dynasty") to claim the elven crown, the future of Quel'Thalas has thus become Lor'themar's alone to guide. Kael's betrayal and the involvement of blood elven forces among Illidan's (and more damningly, the Legion's) army severely hampered relations abroad, and Lor'themar must now also work to repair his people's connections to the other races while he restores Quel'Thalas and governs its people.<sup id="cite_ref-UVG_5-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-UVG-5">[5]</a></sup>

### In the Shadow of the Sun

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/b/be/Lorthemar-theron-full.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20120128125220)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/b/be/Lorthemar-theron-full.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120128125220)

Lor'themar as depicted in [In the Shadow of the Sun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun "In the Shadow of the Sun").

Lor'themar, still with the fresh scars of Kaelthas' betrayal and the civil war that ran concurrent, had become the sole leader of the blood elven people. Despite his status, and despite [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath") and even [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron")'s support in taking on a more prestigious role and attire, Lor'themar maintained that he was merely the regent lord - not the king - citing Anasterian's status as the last king of Quel'Thalas as reason enough not to stake that claim.

After receiving numerous letters from [Archmage Aethas Sunreaver](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Aethas_Sunreaver "Archmage Aethas Sunreaver"), all of which Lor'themar had chosen to ignore, Aethas announced that he would be visiting Silvermoon City. After a brief encounter with Halduron regarding the contents of this visit, the ranger-general likened Lor'themar's professional attitude towards such political matters to that of a king's. Halduron went as far as to offer Lor'themar the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/da/Inv_misc_tournaments_tabard_bloodelf.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20090303233709)[\[Silvermoon City Tabard\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silvermoon_City_Tabard) to better look the part, though Lor'themar wrote the notion off as unnecessary. Halduron reminded him that his role as a [Farstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider "Farstrider") was long behind him now, and that their head of state had to look the part. After observing his stoic [Grand Magister](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister "Grand Magister"), Lor'themar reflected that for all the thorn Rommath had been in his side, he could feel nothing but sympathy for the shattered man after Kael'thas' great betrayal. Lor'themar personally greeted the newly-arrived Archmage, impressed with his ambition and rank for such a young elf, and decides to hear out his plea.

Aethas revealed that [Malygos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malygos "Malygos") the Spellweaver had resolved to destroy all mortal spell-casters and requested the aid of his people in dealing with the threat the crazed aspect poses, on behalf of the Kirin Tor. Though Lor'themar remained neutral in the matter, Rommath immediately denied the request, citing the Kirin Tor's refusal to assist the sin'dorei as they faced execution in the dungeons of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran"). Aethas persisted, though Rommath assured him that none of his [magisters](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magisters "Magisters") would assist the Kirin Tor with this task. He coldly noted that only the regent lord can overrule the [Grand Magister](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister "Grand Magister")'s judgment.

Lor'themar asserted his authority on the matter and silenced their bickering. He mentioned that he had business in the [south](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eastern_Plaguelands "Eastern Plaguelands"), extended his hospitality to the Archmage, and retired to his quarters. After conferring with Halduron, he concluded that perhaps aid would be acceptable if Aethas was given a boundary to work within - reporting back to Quel'Thalas directly, though not representing it officially. Halduron took amusement in the thought and likened his words to that of a king's once more.

Days later, atop his [hawkstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hawkstrider "Hawkstrider"), Lor'themar, and several [Farstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider "Farstrider") honor guards begin the journey south. Halduron expressed disdain for Lor'themar's decision to partake in the journey, though Lor'themar continued on. As he traveled through the [Ghostlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghostlands "Ghostlands"), Lor'themar's ranger roots couldn't help but force repulsion upon him as he observed the fate that befell southern Quel'Thalas—the fate that would befall more of it were it not for the tireless efforts of those who had perished to protect it.

Lor'themar arrived at his destination, the [Quel'Lithien Lodge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Lithien_Lodge "Quel'Lithien Lodge") that he and his fellow Farstriders had many a time visited as heroes of their people. He was greeted by the cold response of the quel'dorei rangers present, and after a harsh exchange with them, he threw down his weapons. Lor'themar requested an audience with a former comrade - one [Ranger Lord Hawkspear](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_Lord_Hawkspear "Ranger Lord Hawkspear"), and [Aurora Skycaller](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aurora_Skycaller "Aurora Skycaller"). It was granted, and Lor'themar came face-to-face with the embittered Hawkspear and Skycaller. Lor'themar revealed that a number of the [Sunfury](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunfury "Sunfury") had returned to Quel'Thalas, and Hawkspear asked as to whether the return of the prince's forces meant Lor'themar was here to apologize on behalf of Kael'thas. Lor'themar said that would likely be so, if the prince was still alive. As a shocked Hawkspear heard the tale, Lor'themar painfully told the story of the fate that befell their scion, and Aurora concluded that the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") had thus been returned to its people.

Hawkspear inquired about who would take the crown of [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)"), and Lor'themar—referencing Prince Kael'thas' royal decree that [King Anasterian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anasterian "Anasterian") would be the last king of Quel'Thalas—stated that there were none alive with any right to it. Having informed them of this turn of events, Lor'themar mentioned that now the Ghostlands have become far more secure with the Sunfury's input, he could offer the battered quel'dorei aid and supplies. Despite Lor'themar's good intentions, however, Hawkspear was furious at the notion. He revealed that Lor'themar had banished those few who opposed Rommath's radical teachings from their home rather than lead a nation divided and that they have been forced to scrape a living within the harsh plaguelands rather than their homes. In addition, he mentioned that xref:Horde.adoc[Horde] agents on behalf of one [Nathanos Blightcaller](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathanos_Blightcaller "Nathanos Blightcaller") had attacked the lodge, ransacking their documents for a [registry](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_Registry "Quel'Thalas Registry") and killing several rangers in the process. Hawkspear stated that these Forsaken were Lor'themar's allies, and that by rights he should kill Lor'themar in retaliation, and send his head to [Sylvanas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas "Sylvanas").

Lor'themar attempted to mend their bridges, assuring them that he was entirely unaware, though it was to no avail. Hawkspear couldn't bring himself to order his death; instead, he outright demanded that Lor'themar begone from the lodge and that any "aid" he dared send to Quel'Lithien would be returned to him wrapped around its bearers' hearts. The regent lord immediately left with his Farstriders and found himself wounded far deeper than he had expected. Reflecting on Hawkspear's words, he made the journey back to Silvermoon in the chilling snowfall. One of his Farstriders suggested he don his cloak, though Lor'themar only lamented that he could not possibly feel any colder.

Upon his return, Aethas inquired about how his journey was conducted - specifically, if as a ranger he could find some common ground with one who opposed the blood elves being allowed entry to [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") - another ranger named [Vereesa Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa_Windrunner "Vereesa Windrunner"). After Rommath and Halduron concluded that the journey was a failure, Aethas deduced that such a thing is thus unlikely, and Lor'themar informed him that his deduction was correct. Later, Lor'themar reiterated the tale to Halduron, and reasons that he had no choice but to banish them; that he could not possibly afford to lead a nation violently divided at that point. They spoke of Nathanos, and Lor'themar couldn't bring himself to believe that their former comrade could have turned on the quel'dorei so. However, Halduron encouraged the embittered regent lord, and reasoned that while trusting the Forsaken was a risk, no one else would fight for Quel'Thalas.

Later, Lor'themar began to consider how to deal with Aethas' request. He was interrupted by a courier, who stated that an individual of importance was here to see him. Lor'themar noted that he was unavailable, though the courier informed him that the [Banshee Queen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Banshee_Queen "Banshee Queen") would not wait. Lor'themar quickly ventured into [Sunfury Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunfury_Spire "Sunfury Spire") to meet with the Dark Lady; Halduron and Rommath flanking him. He stared upon Sylvanas with a listless interest; the wounds of the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") invasion coming back to him after looking upon her face. Sylvanas informed him that the Horde has declared war on the [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King"), and insisted that as fellow members of the Horde, the sin'dorei dedicate troops. Lor'themar was apprehensive, citing that he had only just overcome the civil war at [Quel'Danas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Danas "Quel'Danas"). Sylvanas reasoned that if the sin'dorei do not mobilize, they would certainly lose Horde support - specifically, Forsaken support in their lands. With his arm twisted, Lor'themar relented, and agreed to send troops to the [Undercity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Undercity "Undercity"), though Rommath was less willing to give into Sylvanas' orders. Lor'themar silenced a brief argument between his enraged Grand Magister and the Dark Lady and bid his former ranger-general a [Thalassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalassian "Thalassian") farewell.

Rommath was outraged and confronted Lor'themar for giving in to what was essentially blackmail. Lor'themar stated that he did what needed to be done for the survival of Quel'Thalas, even if that meant playing the role of a pawn. Rommath simply informed him that [another leader of the sin'dorei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas "Kael'thas") had once said something similar to him and that Rommath did not challenge him; indeed, at the time he thought him right - and that they had buried him on Quel'Danas. He left to inform the [Blood Knight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Knight "Blood Knight") leadership of the Regent Lord's decision.

Lor'themar informed Halduron of what had been decided and ordered him to prepare the Farstriders for battle. Halduron also appeared somewhat disheartened by Lor'themar's decision, treating him with an uncharacteristically cold courtesy, though unlike Rommath, he did not vocalize his concerns. Lor'themar then finally agrees to support Aethas' endeavor, though not on behalf of the Kirin Tor. He sent Aethas to confer with Rommath, and Lor'themar, seething, noted that Quel'Thalas was still ruled by his will alone.

### Wrath of the Lich King

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/74/Lor%27thesunwell.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20110325183244)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/74/Lor%27thesunwell.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110325183244)

Lor'themar and [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath") observe the restored [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell").

Following the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell")'s restoration and the monumental events that transpired on [Quel'Danas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Danas "Quel'Danas"), Lor'themar Theron has opened the sacred site as a place of worship for his people; the Sunwell itself now heavily guarded with [Arcane Guardians](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Guardian "Arcane Guardian") and [Sunwell Honor Guards](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell_Honor_Guard "Sunwell Honor Guard"). He has also allowed pilgrims - both blood elven and high elven - to visit it directly. Lor'themar himself was seen standing before the Sunwell during the quest to restore [Quel'Delar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Delar "Quel'Delar"), alongside [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath"), [Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Liadrin "Liadrin"), and [Auric Sunchaser](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Auric_Sunchaser "Auric Sunchaser"). He was initially skeptical of the blade's authenticity, though quickly changes his opinion upon inspection.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/5/51/Therondelar.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20120620165000)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/5/51/Therondelar.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120620165000)

Lor'themar claims [Quel'Delar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Delar "Quel'Delar").

For a non-blood elf, Lor'themar thanks the player for returning Quel'Delar to "its rightful owners," and attempts to take it. However, the blade does not recognize him as its wielder and hurls him back across the plateau; cutting off a large portion of his health. Rommath and the Sunwell's guards move to intercept and seize the player and Auric for this apparent treachery, though after some defusing Auric is able to salvage the situation. Rommath instead demands the player begone with the blade, if it is truly not meant to be theirs.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

For blood elf players, Lor'themar simply observes Quel'Delar as it is purified in the Sunwell. Lor'themar, Rommath, and Auric all give words of support for the sin'dorei player's part in restoring the blade, and Lor'themar bows before them. Lor'themar names the player a hero and inspiration to the sin'dorei, a "symbol of our endurance in the face of tragedy and treachery," and Rommath instructs them to take the reforged blade to [Archmage Aethas Sunreaver](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Aethas_Sunreaver "Archmage Aethas Sunreaver").<sup id="cite_ref-PofQ_3-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-PofQ-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Cataclysm

[![Cataclysm](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/ef/Cata-Logo-Small.png/revision/latest?cb=20120818171714)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "Cataclysm") **This section concerns content related to _[Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "World of Warcraft: Cataclysm")_.**

With the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") restored, a new path to glory now lies ahead for the blood elves. After presiding over [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)") through its darkest days, Lor'themar has resolved to lead his people into their prosperous future and has openly encouraged them to turn to the Sunwell to sate their magical addiction. While many blood elves are heeding the regent lord's words, a few are still reluctant to break their dependency on arcane magic.<sup id="cite_ref-us.battle.net_11-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-us.battle.net-11">[11]</a></sup>

After the [Amani](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Amani "Amani") empire declared itself reborn, [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron") and the [Farstriders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders") left to do battle with them in [Zul'Aman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Aman "Zul'Aman") with the help of [Chieftain Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") and his [elite forces](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Siame-Quashi "Siame-Quashi"). Overstretched, the ranger-general also called upon [Vereesa Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa_Windrunner "Vereesa Windrunner") and her rangers to lend their aid to the battle, and protect Quel'Thalas from the Amani invasion. Lor'themar learned of Vereesa traveling to the [Ghostlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghostlands "Ghostlands"), a turn of events that he appeared to be irritated by. He sent a [messenger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silvermoon_Messenger "Silvermoon Messenger") to Halduron, also stationed in the Ghostlands, demanding to know the meaning behind her presence. After a brief confrontation with Halduron over his decision to invite an "exile" into their lands, Lor'themar's messenger learned of the three-way assault being put into motion by Vol'jin, Halduron, and Vereesa against Zul'Aman, and was sent back to Silvermoon with word of their plans for battle.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

### Tides of War

Lor'themar was present during the Horde leader meeting between [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"), [Chieftain Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin"), [Baine Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof"), [Trade Prince Gallywix](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Prince_Gallywix "Trade Prince Gallywix"), [Eitrigg](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eitrigg "Eitrigg"), [Malkorok](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malkorok "Malkorok"), and [Garrosh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh "Garrosh") himself, sitting to Garrosh's right. While most of the other leaders were prone to scrutinizing the Warchief, Lor'themar appeared more geared towards (or at least tolerant of) Garrosh's side, who in turn has developed a certain respect for the regent lord.

Lor'themar was impassive regarding Sylvanas' worries pertaining to the fall of [Theramore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Theramore "Theramore"), despite Sylvanas believing the Forsaken and the sin'dorei would be most at risk of retaliation. Lor'themar ignored her repeatedly during the meeting, despite Sylvanas' attempts to play upon the regent lord's sympathy and get him to back her up.

Garrosh later summoned Lor'themar for a private audience, thanking him for his loyalty. When prompted to discuss the nature of said loyalty, Lor'themar made it clear that he was loyal to the Horde, though Garrosh reminded him that he _is_ the Horde. Lor'themar corrected him, stating that he was merely its leader. As Garrosh observed the sin'dorei retinue leave Orgrimmar, he uneasily concluded that Theron, in particular, was worth watching.

Lor'themar and Sylvanas were later expected to aid in the Theramore attack, though neither do so. Instead, Lor'themar and [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron") opt to send [Kelantir Bloodblade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kelantir_Bloodblade "Kelantir Bloodblade") and two ships of blood elven warriors on their behalf.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

### Mists of Pandaria

#### Landfall

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/d7/One_Last_Grasp_Silvermoon.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20190727095903)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/d7/One_Last_Grasp_Silvermoon.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190727095903)

Lor'themar, [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron"), [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath"), and a rescued [Aethas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas "Aethas") back in Silvermoon.

Lor'themar was summoned to [Pandaria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pandaria "Pandaria") by [Warchief Garrosh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh_Hellscream "Garrosh Hellscream") and left with a [Reliquary](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Reliquary "Reliquary") excavation and a retinue of [rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders") and [Blood Knights](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Knights "Blood Knights") for protection. Lor'themar was first seen in the [Shrine of Two Moons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shrine_of_Two_Moons "Shrine of Two Moons") alongside his bodyguard, [Ellendra Palescorn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ellendra_Palescorn "Ellendra Palescorn"), Garrosh, and [Malkorok](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malkorok "Malkorok"). Lor'themar clashed with Garrosh after the warchief failed to warn him of a strong [mogu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mogu "Mogu") presence in [Kun-Lai Summit](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kun-Lai_Summit "Kun-Lai Summit"), though pushed on with his orders to uncover mogu artifacts in the area. Later, Lor'themar sent [Horde agents](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") along with [Ranger Orestes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_Orestes "Ranger Orestes") and [Blood Knight Aenea](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aenea "Aenea") to discreetly fight their way through the mogu-controlled [Valley of the Emperors](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_the_Emperors "Valley of the Emperors"), and to capture and interrogate the mogu leaders before Garrosh – who Lor'themar concluded is skeptical of his loyalty at this point – could hamper their chances of a subtle victory.

Lor'themar became increasingly wary of Garrosh's emulation of the mogu, a race of belligerent conquerors whose brutal reign saw them overthrown by the more moderate xref:Pandaren.adoc[Pandaren]. After the meeting with Garrosh and Baine in the [Imperial Mercantile](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Mercantile "Imperial Mercantile") in the Shrine of Two Moons, Theron returned to Silvermoon and was ordered by Garrosh to uncover the secrets of a certain mogu device. Lor'themar put [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath") to the task, and called upon [Archmage Aethas Sunreaver](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Aethas_Sunreaver "Archmage Aethas Sunreaver") to assist him in figuring out this quandary. Rommath made considerable progress with its understanding, though a rampant [sha](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sha "Sha") was released in the chamber, compelling the grand magister and Aethas – their emotions heightened by the sha – to come to blows. Horde heroes and the Silvermoon guards were able to contain the threat, and Lor'themar arrived to bear witness to it.

Lor'themar reiterated his past as a [ranger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_ranger "Elven ranger"), and why the sin'dorei were part of the modern Horde. However, coming under the same disregard and scrutiny on behalf of Garrosh as the blood elves had suffered under [Garithos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garithos "Garithos") years before, Lor'themar considered looking into “[Old Alliances](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance").” Rumors of Lor'themar's dissatisfaction with Garrosh's leadership began to spread within the Horde's ranks, and Theron himself entered into talks with [King Varian Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/King_Varian_Wrynn "King Varian Wrynn") to negotiate [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom) "Quel'Thalas (kingdom)") back into the xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance].

Theron then waited in Garrosh'ar Advance while Garrosh and Baine interrogated [Shan Kien](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shan_Kien "Shan Kien"). Garrosh organized a heist in [Darnassus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darnassus "Darnassus") that led to the blaming of the blood elves and thus sabotaging Theron's diplomatic efforts.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-ReferenceA-1">[1]</a></sup> With [Fanlyr Silverthorn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fanlyr_Silverthorn "Fanlyr Silverthorn")'s help, members of the Horde took the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/72/Inv_misc_bell_01.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20180222193728)[\[Divine Bell\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Bell) from the Alliance and sent it to Silvermoon. [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"), leader of the Kirin Tor, was quickly able to discover that someone within her organization helped the Horde circumvent her wards. Enraged at what she believed to be another [betrayal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalen_Songweaver "Thalen Songweaver"), Jaina [led a purge of the Sunreavers from Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Purge_of_Dalaran "Purge of Dalaran"), with many being imprisoned while others killed. Rommath himself led a rescue mission that saw Aethas and a number of Sunreavers rescued, though many more were said to still be imprisoned in the [Violet Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Hold "Violet Hold"). Lor'themar and Halduron quickly moved to oversee the return of the rescued elves in the [Court of the Sun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Court_of_the_Sun "Court of the Sun").

After giving a speech about how Jaina's purge was inexcusable and her actions reaffirmed his belief in supposed Alliance bigotry, and the fact they also had led the blood elves back to Hellscream's Horde to [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath"), [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron"), and [Aethas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas "Aethas"), Lor'themar concluded that Garrosh had bought his [new treasure](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Bell "Divine Bell") with the blood of Lor'themar's people, and hoped dearly that it destroyed him. Lor'themar ordered Rommath to summon the [blood magi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_mage "Blood mage") and add the [Sunreavers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunreavers "Sunreavers")' strength to his own, and for Halduron to assemble the [rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders"). Rommath commented that Lor'themar would make "a fine Warchief", and noting that it might come to that. Theron demanded his blades and vowed that the next move would belong to him.

#### Rise of the Thunder King

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/38/Theron_Crimson_Treader.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130203142901)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/38/Theron_Crimson_Treader.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130203142901)

Lor'themar aboard his [destroyer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Destroyer#Elven_destroyer "Destroyer"), the _[Crimson Treader](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Treader "Crimson Treader")_.

Lor'themar took command of the Horde forces moving against the newly-returned [Thunder King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_King "Thunder King"), christening his force (a coalition of [Sunreavers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunreavers "Sunreavers"), [Magisters](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magisters "Magisters") and [rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders"), among others) the [Sunreaver Onslaught](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunreaver_Onslaught "Sunreaver Onslaught").

With Garrosh focusing solely on attacking the xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance] from [Domination Point](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Domination_Point "Domination Point"), Lor'themar mobilized the Onslaught against the threat [Lei Shen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lei_Shen "Lei Shen") posed to all of [Pandaria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pandaria "Pandaria"). Lor'themar's reasoning was twofold: for justice, and to claim the emperor's weaponry for himself, as leverage against Garrosh. Lor'themar suspected that a Horde uprising was on the cards, and believed it was best to be prepared for it. The conflict on the isle posed the first major martial affair Lor'themar had engaged in since being named regent lord, and Theron expressed that it would be good to find himself in the midst of battle again.

Lor'themar at [Dawnseeker Promontory](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dawnseeker_Promontory "Dawnseeker Promontory").

From his [destroyer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Destroyer "Destroyer"), the _[Crimson Treader](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Treader "Crimson Treader")_, Lor'themar went about forming an alliance with the [Shado-Pan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shado-Pan "Shado-Pan"). Lor'themar oversaw the construction of the [Dawnseeker Promontory](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dawnseeker_Promontory "Dawnseeker Promontory"), directing agents of the Horde to strike against the Kirin Tor's base camp and to back up Halduron's attempts to battle the xref:Zandalari.adoc[Zandalari]. As the war effort progressed, Lor'themar personally led the Sunreavers' attacks against the Thunder King's stronghold, the regent lord's presence on the front lines posing a danger to his person that [Scout Captain Elsia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_Captain_Elsia "Scout Captain Elsia") was fearful of; however, Lor'themar maintained that getting his hands dirty was long overdue. Lor'themar commandeered the [Lightning Vein Mine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Vein_Mine "Lightning Vein Mine") after the [rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunreaver_Ranger "Sunreaver Ranger") finished off its defenders, and Theron planned to have Horde metalsmiths study mogu fabrication techniques for his own ends.

Later, the Regent Lord met with [Taran Zhu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Taran_Zhu "Taran Zhu") and [Taoshi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Taoshi "Taoshi") who prepared the attack on Stormsea Landing. When Lor'themar saw  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/aa/Inv_jewelry_necklace_106.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20120621144104)[\[Choker of Storms\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Choker_of_Storms), he immediately recognized to be a powerful artifact and claimed that Aethas would examine it.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/1b/Hordeside_Bloodied_Crossing.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130313005435)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/1b/Hordeside_Bloodied_Crossing.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130313005435)

[Lor'themar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar "Lor'themar") and [Aethas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas "Aethas") battling the xref:Zandalari.adoc[Zandalari] at the [Bloodied Crossing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodied_Crossing "Bloodied Crossing").

Lor'themar ultimately led the Horde advance into the [Bloodied Crossing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodied_Crossing "Bloodied Crossing"), aiding Lord Taran Zhu's assault on the Thunder King's stronghold. Both [Elsia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_Captain_Elsia "Scout Captain Elsia") and [Aethas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas "Aethas") aided him in this task, along with a contingent of [rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunreaver_Ranger "Sunreaver Ranger"). Lor'themar's forces were not alone, however -- [Lady Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Jaina_Proudmoore "Lady Jaina Proudmoore") herself led the Alliance advance into the courtyard. Lor'themar stated that he would deal with Jaina himself if need be, and the Horde and Alliance groups focused on dealing with [Shan Bu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shan_Bu "Shan Bu")'s legions before turning to one another.

Lor'themar and Jaina faced off after Shan Bu was dealt with. Lor'themar demanded the release of the [Sunreavers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunreavers "Sunreavers") from the [Violet Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Hold "Violet Hold"), professing their innocence in Garrosh's raid on Darnassus. Jaina rebuked him with the notion that they were prisoners of war, and that she would let him leave alive if Aethas was handed over to her. Theron refused this demand, though the parties were interrupted by an injured Taran Zhu, who ordered both Lor'themar and Jaina to stand down and move on from this conflict.

After some convincing (Jaina citing the Horde's lack of effort with peace, Lor'themar stating his duty to protect his [sovereign people](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_elf "Blood elf")), Lor'themar and Jaina agreed to retreat bloodlessly. Jaina made it clear that no true peace would be achieved while Garrosh Hellscream rules the Horde, though to her surprise, Lor'themar stated that _that_ is precisely why he wished to conserve his strength today. Jaina's expression softened at his answer, and the two leaders left their "parley" with courteous bows.

Ultimately, Lor'themar acquired the leverage he had sought to find on the isle: heroes of the Horde delivered to the regent lord a crystal charged with the power of the [Dark Animus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Animus "Dark Animus"), which Lor'themar used to re-empower a dormant [Animus Golem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Animus_Golem "Animus Golem") at the promontory. Lor'themar put his top archmages to the task of extensively studying it.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

#### Escalation

Lor'themar came into contact with [Chieftain Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") of the [Darkspear tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_tribe "Darkspear tribe") and threw his support behind Vol'jin's [burgeoning rebellion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_Rebellion "Darkspear Rebellion") to overthrow Garrosh. However, with the Warchief oppressing, arresting, and executing members of the Darkspear as Lor'themar was still finishing up on the Isle of Thunder (and across the sea besides), Vol'jin was forced to take a more immediate approach and declared open rebellion against Garrosh.

#### Siege of Orgrimmar

After the [Sha of Pride](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sha_of_Pride "Sha of Pride") was unearthed in the [Vale of Eternal Blossoms](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vale_of_Eternal_Blossoms "Vale of Eternal Blossoms"), [Lorewalker Cho](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lorewalker_Cho "Lorewalker Cho") fled the scene to get help, returning with both Lor'themar and [Jaina](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina "Jaina"). Jaina told the Regent Lord that she was not surprised that Garrosh's arrogance unleashed the Sha upon the [Vale of Eternal Blossoms](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vale_of_Eternal_Blossoms "Vale of Eternal Blossoms"). They also noticed that Garrosh left [Gorehowl](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gorehowl "Gorehowl") behind. Lor'themar, along with Sylvanas's Forsaken and most of the Alliance, returned from Pandaria and stormed the [Bladefist Bay](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bladefist_Bay "Bladefist Bay").

On board, Theron and Sylvanas discussed if she could raise dead elves. He forbade it but did not care about the human ones. After capturing the bay and docks from the hands of the [Dragonmaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonmaw "Dragonmaw") orcs led by [Warlord Zaela](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlord_Zaela "Warlord Zaela") atop of [Galakras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Galakras "Galakras"), he and his blood elves made contact with [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") and [Baine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof") at the front gates of xref:Orgrimmar.adoc[Orgrimmar] and arrived to aid them. Theron brought all his people's resources to the Siege of Orgrimmar, Blood Knights included.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

Lor'themar was present along with the rest of the Horde's leadership (barring [Ji Firepaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ji_Firepaw "Ji Firepaw"), who was injured earlier in the siege) at the defeat and arrest of Garrosh. When Thrall named [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") the new Warchief, Lor'themar bowed in respect.

### War Crimes

Lor'themar, accompanied by [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron"), was present during [Garrosh Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh_Hellscream "Garrosh Hellscream")'s trial on [Pandaria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pandaria "Pandaria"), along with the other leaders of the Horde and Alliance. He took an issue with the [Celestials](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Celestials "Celestials") serving as Garrosh's sole judges, jury, and executioners, though [Taran Zhu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Taran_Zhu "Taran Zhu") assured his friend that would not be the case. Lor'themar agreed with Vol'jin's proposition to seat Baine as Garrosh's defender, thinking him suitable for the role, though believed it was a mistake to veto Varian as their former leader's accuser. Theron and [Vereesa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa "Vereesa") exchanged positive courtesies during the trial, to [Sylvanas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas "Sylvanas")' surprise.

In a [Thalassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalassian "Thalassian") conversation, the regent lord and the dark lady discussed the day's outcomes; acknowledging Lor'themar's lingering [resentment](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun "In the Shadow of the Sun") towards her from their past conflict, Sylvanas [again](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_War "Tides of War") tried to foster a "partnership" between them, to no avail. After Garrosh escaped, Theron and many others heard the verdict from the [August Celestials](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/August_Celestial "August Celestial").<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

Lor'themar listens to [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") naming the new Warchief of the Horde

Lor'themar was present among the gathering of faction leaders in neutral [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") after the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") once more returned to ravage Azeroth. He was not eager to return to the Violet City after the [Purge of Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Purge_of_Dalaran "Purge of Dalaran"), but Warchief Vol'jin, who trusted Khadgar as much as he concurred with Theron's wariness, decided the Horde would attend.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

Lor'themar witnessed the death of [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") in the [Grommash Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grommash_Hold "Grommash Hold") and was present at his funeral ceremony in the [Dranosh'ar Blockade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dranosh%27ar_Blockade "Dranosh'ar Blockade"). He fought against the [Felblade Assassins](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felblade_Assassin "Felblade Assassin") that infiltrated the place.

When a xref:Horde.adoc[Horde] player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Theron can be found in the [Undercity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Undercity "Undercity") alongside other notable leaders of the Horde.

At the end of the Heritage questline.

Lor'themar agreed with Lady Liadrin's positive opinion on the [nightborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne "Nightborne") of [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar"), considering their kingdoms much alike. He invited the nightborne leader, [First Arcanist Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_Arcanist_Thalyssra "First Arcanist Thalyssra"), to Silvermoon for a visit. Concurrently, he entertained another guest, his old Farstrider comrade [Alleria Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner"), who had come to try and convince the regent lord to have Quel'Thalas leave the Horde and rejoin the Alliance. Lor'themar reacted curtly to Alleria's offer, stating only that he'd hoped she would return to Silvermoon out of love for her homeland, not as the [boy-king's](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Wrynn "Anduin Wrynn") messenger. Alleria asked whether his words were truly his own, or if the noble ranger she'd known had simply become her sister's mouthpiece; Alleria's link to the void was also an issue between them, and Alleria accepted that her offer had been anticipated and spurned. Before leaving, she requested to visit the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"), as it had been a thousand years from her perspective since she'd last laid eyes on it. Rommath, suspicious, was opposed to it, but Lor'themar overruled him, claiming that whatever else she'd become, Alleria was a daughter of Quel'Thalas and he would not deny her a pilgrimage. Lor'themar's first contact with Thalyssra was more positive; the two quickly endeared themselves to one another.

The group took Rommath's portal to the Sunwell, but the holy site was shortly after attacked by void beasts who had been brought forth by Alleria's presence. Lor'themar took part in fighting off the void's agents, including a massive void horror attempting to contaminate the Sunwell directly. After the battle, Lor'themar dismissed Rommath's attempt to have Alleria seized as a saboteur, but banished her on the grounds that her presence posed a direct threat to Quel'Thalas. Lor'themar apologized to Thalyssra for the unexpected turn of events, but the nightborne leader dismissed this, considering the battle a display of his dedication to his people and traditions. Thalyssra then pledged [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar_(kingdom) "Suramar (kingdom)") to the Horde's cause, and Lor'themar assured her that Silvermoon's gates would be open to her.<sup id="cite_ref-Silvermoon_City_quest_8-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Silvermoon_City_quest-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

Lor'themar was one of the leaders of the Horde that fought in the [Battle for Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_Lordaeron "Battle for Lordaeron") defending the Ruins of Lordaeron. In the end, he escaped with Sylvanas and Baine.

Lor'themar alongside Liadrin helps blood elves who are level 60 and Exalted with Silvermoon City to go through an annual ritual remembering the losses of the blood elves to the Scourge, earning their [heritage armor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heritage_armor "Heritage armor").

Lor'themar was present at the coronation of [Queen Talanji](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji "Talanji"), along with other leaders of the Horde.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

When [Baine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof") was arrested and [Zelling](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Zelling "Thomas Zelling") was killed for their parts in freeing [Derek Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Proudmoore "Derek Proudmoore") from Horde captivity, Lor'themar worried that Sylvanas may have just set the Horde down a ruinous path.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

#### Rise of Azshara

Lor'themar later joined the Horde fleet under the command of [Nathanos Blightcaller](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathanos_Blightcaller "Nathanos Blightcaller"), who used the [black blade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xal%27atath "Xal'atath") to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards [Nazjatar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazjatar "Nazjatar") where both would be attacked by the naga under [Queen Azshara](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Azshara "Queen Azshara")'s command after the seas opened.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Following the attack, Nathanos departed to complete his own mission and in his absence, Lor'themar rallied the Horde forces together.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> He directed the Speaker of the Horde to aid [Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalyssra "Thalyssra") and ordered for his rangers to provide what aid they could to the Speaker.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Following the death of [Tidemistress Ethendriss](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tidemistress_Ethendriss "Tidemistress Ethendriss"), the Speaker, Lor'themar, and Thalyssra ventured further into Nazjatar where they encountered [Neri Sharpfin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Neri_Sharpfin "Neri Sharpfin"), the leader of the [Unshackled](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Unshackled "Unshackled").<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> As they ventured together, they were confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara, who boosted that Nazjatar would be the last thing they would see and promised that she would hold the waters around Nazjatar at bay as long as she remained entertained.

Deciding to work together, the Unshackled allowed the Horde to reinforce their base of [Newhome](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Newhome "Newhome").<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> As the Horde established itself, Lor'themar sent scouts to check out [Azshara's palace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eternal_Palace "Eternal Palace"), however, the scouts never returned. Seeking to discover what became of them, Lor'themar turned to [Spiritwalker Ussoh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spiritwalker_Ussoh "Spiritwalker Ussoh") who used his abilities to discover that the scouts were dead.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Recognizing that his troops were weary and needed rest, Lor'themar turned to the Unshackled who offered to aid them. Realizing that the best way to survive against Azshara's forces was to support the Horde's new allies, Lor'themar entrusted the Speaker to join with [one of their hunters](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_allies "Combat allies") and aid them in their tasks, as he plotted the Horde's next move.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

Lor'themar later turned to Neri in order to discover what insight she could provide against the naga,<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> and Neri and the Speaker would set out against them in order to rescue enslaved members of the kelfin.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Lor'themar would later regroup with his allies and revealed to them that the Azerite weapons used by the naga were created by [Lady Ashvane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Ashvane "Lady Ashvane").<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Informed of Ashvane's rescue by Azshara causes Lor'themar to realize that he had underestimated Azshara's influence and was content in securing the Azerite weapons for his allies.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Despite this victory Lor'themar knew that their situation remained perilous. As he considered the Horde's next move he encouraged the Speaker to further improve relations with the Unshackled as they would need their aid in the battles to come. By showing them unity, Lor'themar believed that it would teach them that there were no obstacles that could stand in the Horde's way.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

Lor'themar was informed by Spiritwalker Ussoh that the tauren had received a vision in which Sylvanas ordered Baine's death, causing Lor'themar to declare that they must stop the vision from coming to pass.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Though Lor'themar followed her orders through peacetime and war, he found he couldn't follow her orders now. Declaring that Baine's execution would drive a blade into the very heart of the Horde, he then directed the Speaker to [meet](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") [with allies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varok_Saurfang "Varok Saurfang") within the [Cleft of Shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cleft_of_Shadow "Cleft of Shadow") in order to save Baine. He further declared that Baine represented the best of the Horde but warned that when Sylvanas learned of their defiance her wrath would be swift and terrible.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> Following the successful rescue, Lor'themar thanked the Speaker for saving Baine's life and voiced surprise that [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") and [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw") came to his aid as well. In turn, Thalyssra was surprised by Lor'themar's shock, as she recalled the Horde and Alliance [working together](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightfallen_rebellion "Nightfallen rebellion") to liberate Suramar from the Legion, which caused Lor'themar to reveal that cooperation between the sides was more the exception than the rule. Thalyssra countered that their animosity only strengthened Azshara and that divided neither Horde or the Alliance would be a match for her. Lor'themar retorted that as long as Sylvanas had the loyalty of the people and as long as she was Warchief, the war would never end in their hearts, causing Thalyssra to muse that it might enough to simply direct their attacks against Azshara over the Alliance. After [recalling Taran Zhu's words](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fall_of_Shan_Bu "The Fall of Shan Bu"), Lor'themar declared that Thalyssra was correct and that they needed to focus their attacks on Azshara but warned that if the Alliance undermined their efforts the flames of war would rise again.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

Seeking to gain control of the Tidestone away from Azshara, Lor'themar directed Thalyssra and the Speaker to investigate the ruins of [Zin-Azshari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zin-Azshari "Zin-Azshari") for anything potent enough to counter Azshara's sorcery.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> After Lor'themar learned that the [Javelins of Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Javelins_of_Suramar "Javelins of Suramar") were obtained, he declared that the javelins would allow them to obtain the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/47/Inv_misc_enchantedpearl.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20100930220042)[\[Tidestone of Golganneth\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tidestone_of_Golganneth).<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> Declaring that now was the time to act, Lor'themar directed the Horde to take the fight to the naga. En route, however, the Horde encountered Alliance forces led by Jaina and [Genn Greymane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Genn_Greymane "Genn Greymane") and after a brief argument, both sides agreed to fight together against Azshara's forces, where during the fighting Lor'themar fought side by side with Genn. After the Javelins of Suramar were used to shatter the Tidestone's protective barrier around [Lady Zharessa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Zharessa "Lady Zharessa"), Lor'themar joined the fight against Azshara's champion.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> After Jaina and Thalyssra combined their magics in order to use the Tidestone to open the way to [Azshara's Palace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azshara%27s_Palace "Azshara's Palace"), Lor'themar warned that they couldn't underestimate Azshara as she was one of the most powerful sorceresses alive but declared, nevertheless, that she must be defeated. However, Lor'themar and Jaina argued about which side would deal the final blow to the Queen only to be interrupted by Azshara herself, who formally invited all of them to enter her palace.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

Shandris, Jaina, Lor'themar, and Thalyssra in the Eternal Palace.

Accepting Azshara's invitation, Lor'themar was among the forces to strike at the heart of Azshara's power. He and Jaina ventured deep into the [Last Prison](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Prison "Last Prison"), where the queen prepared a ritual to free her benefactor [N'Zoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/N%27Zoth "N'Zoth"). As Thalyssra, [Shandris Feathermoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shandris_Feathermoon "Shandris Feathermoon"), and heroes of Azeroth made their descent into the prison, Azshara taunted them with news of Lor'themar and Jaina's fall, but her words proved false: Lor'themar and Jaina, along with Thalyssra, Shandris, and the heroes, fought together to defeat Azshara. After the battle, Lor'themar and Jaina approached the fallen queen with weapons drawn, but the chains binding N'Zoth shattered and the Old God subsequently rescued Azshara. Though triumphant over Azshara, Lor'themar considered it a hollow victory as not only did Azshara survive but N'Zoth was freed. He also agreed with Jaina's assessment that the [Fourth War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War") has kept them distracted and that divided they had no hope against N'Zoth. Thus Lor'themar vowed to tell his people of what transpired in Nazjatar, of how Azshara fell because the Horde and Alliance stood together, and of the rising threat of N'Zoth. Then he vowed to take his place besides Saurfang and Thrall.

Lor'themar and Thalyssra met Saurfang's loyalists, and the regent lord bluntly revealed that the [war](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War") has been costly and that battle against Azshara drained what little resources the Horde had left. He further revealed that Sylvanas was now in position to destroy her enemies and he no longer believed that Sylvanas would see reason. Thus, Lor'themar honored his word and joined Saurfang in his revolution and warned that Saurfang had some [unlikely allies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance").<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> After the revolutionaries and Alliance secured the [Dranosh'ar Blockade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dranosh%27ar_Blockade "Dranosh'ar Blockade"), Varok's sought to attack xref:Orgrimmar.adoc[Orgrimmar] from all three entrances at once. Thus, he directed Lor'themar and Shandris to lead their forces to attack the city from [Azshara](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azshara "Azshara").<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

However, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to [Mak'gora](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mak%27gora "Mak'gora"), which ultimately ended in Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Lor'themar was stunned by Saurfang's death and wondered what Sylvanas gained by abandoning the Horde.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Lor'themar then ordered for [Baine Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof") to be informed of what transpired and that it was time them to stand united as the xref:Horde.adoc[Horde] once more.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Declaring that Saurfang gave his life to heal the rift in the Horde, that his death was that of a hero, and that they shall honor his sacrifice. Thus, Lor'themar attended Saurfang's funeral.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Lor'themar admitted that a part of him will now always wonder if he could have stopped conflict within the Horde if he had confronted Sylvanas after [Teldrassil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Teldrassil "Teldrassil") and lamented that it was not an easy thing to watch friend tread a dark path. Lor'themar remarked that though he had ordered for the [Farstriders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstriders "Farstriders") with tracking down Sylvanas and Nathanos, he was unsure if they could find them.

#### Visions of N'Zoth

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/9d/Horde_Council.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20200207222227)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/9d/Horde_Council.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200207222227)

Lor'themar on the [Horde Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council").

In the aftermath of [N'Zoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/N%27Zoth "N'Zoth")'s death and the end of the [Fourth War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War"), Lor'themar and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the [Grand Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance"), putting the [Fourth War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War") on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, Lor'themar Theron addressed the absence of a [Warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warchief "Warchief"). Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the [Horde Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council") was created, with Lor'themar representing the blood elven people. In the aftermath of the council's formation, Thalyssra invited Lor'themar to visit her in [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar") and revealed that both [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing") (who promised to keep [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas "Quel'Thalas") secure) and [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister_Rommath "Grand Magister Rommath") (who threatened to just teleport Lor'themar to the [Nighthold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nighthold "Nighthold")) endorsed this visit. In response, Lor'themar said that his closet allies had conspired against him which caused Thalyssra to ask if it required a conspiracy for them to spend time alone together. However, Lor'themar was quick to reassure her that it would be his pleasure to visit.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

With the war against the Alliance to end, Lor'themar believed that the Horde must look to its future.

### A Moment in Verse

Lor'themar noted that both Rommath and Halduron had taken an unusual interest in his journey to [Suramar City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar_City "Suramar City"). Lor'themar believed that Rommath possibly uttered "Go, you love-addled buffoon, or I will strangle you myself" as Lor'themar departed. After arriving to Suramar, he was personally greeted by [First Arcanist Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_Arcanist_Thalyssra "First Arcanist Thalyssra"), and later the pair competed with another in a friendly poetry contest. She found Lor'themar's poem [The Adder](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Adder "The Adder") to be marvelously done and recognized that it was about [Kael'thas Sunstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider "Kael'thas Sunstrider")'s betrayal of the blood elven people. Meanwhile, Lor'themar was so moved by Thalyssra's poem [Spirit of the Moment](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_of_the_Moment "Spirit of the Moment") that he found himself standing in applause. Following their friendly competition, the pair conversed. During the conversation, Lor'themar admitted the recent events had made his thoughts linger on the past, and on Kael'thas's betrayal in particular. For her part, Thalyssra asked if he was truly healing from the wounds or merely simply reopening the wounds because they are his. As they reflected on things, they grew closer together only to be interrupted by a messenger revealing that Lor'themar was requested to return to xref:Orgrimmar.adoc[Orgrimmar]. After Lor'themar ordered the messenger to depart, he and Thalyssra shared a kiss, where Lor'themar remarked to himself that the world outside their kiss could wait.<sup id="cite_ref-AMiV_73-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-AMiV-73">[73]</a></sup>

### Shadows Rising

In light of [Queen Talanji](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Talanji "Queen Talanji")'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari [wounds](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Dazar%27alor_(battle) "Battle of Dazar'alor (battle)") during a [Horde Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council") meeting, Lor'themar reminded her that the Horde's resources were stretched thin and that they must be thoughtful if they were to commit their navy to her struggles. Thus, he voiced that they could open negotiations with [Kul Tiras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kul_Tiras "Kul Tiras"), which was soundly rejected by Talanji and [Rokhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rokhan "Rokhan"), and the meeting was soon adjourned by [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") as it fell into bickering. After a failed assassination attempt on Talanji, the [Zandalari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_troll "Zandalari troll") queen and a key ally, prompted Lor'themar and the rest of the Horde leaders to act. They empowered the young [troll](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_troll "Jungle troll") [shaman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman "Shaman") [Zekhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zekhan "Zekhan"), still grieving the loss of [Varok Saurfang](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varok_Saurfang "Varok Saurfang"), with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.

Upon learning that the xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance] was aware of the [unrest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Widow%27s_Bite "Widow's Bite") in [Zandalar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalar "Zandalar"), their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. Upon learning that [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw") was arrested by the [Zandalari Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_Empire "Zandalari Empire"), Lor'themar was of the opinion that the tales of [dark rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_ranger "Dark ranger") on Zandalar were a stretch and voiced that the Alliance was abusing their civility. However, in light of the possibility of the tales of dark rangers being true, Lor'themar voted in support of [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") and [Ji Firepaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ji_Firepaw "Ji Firepaw") to meet [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") and [Anduin Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Wrynn "Anduin Wrynn") due to his hopes that if Sylvanas was in Zandalar, then they could have her in their snares.

When the Horde rallied to aid the Zandalari against the [Widow's Bite](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Widow%27s_Bite "Widow's Bite") and the [Banshee loyalists](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Banshee_loyalists "Banshee loyalists"), Lor'themar and [Gazlowe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gazlowe "Gazlowe") sailed to the [Necropolis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Necropolis_(Nazmir) "Necropolis (Nazmir)") in [Nazmir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazmir "Nazmir") to prevent any possibility of retreat by sea.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

Lor'themar granted [Zekhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zekhan "Zekhan") access to his library, scrolls, and occasionally explains to him the meaning of words. In turn, Zekhan was grateful as it is thanks to him that he knows how to read and write.<sup id="cite_ref-Exploring_Azeroth_Kalimdor_6-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Exploring_Azeroth_Kalimdor-6">[6]</a></sup>

### Death Rising

Lor'themar alongside his [fellow council members](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council") convened atop of [Grommash Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grommash_Hold "Grommash Hold") where they informed Horde [champions](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") of the [return of the](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Rising "Death Rising") [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") and the abduction of [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") and [Baine Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof"), which Lor'themar saw as being done to undermine the council's stability. They also learned from [Valeera Sanguinar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Valeera_Sanguinar "Valeera Sanguinar") that [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") and [Anduin Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Wrynn "Anduin Wrynn") had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on [Tyrande Whisperwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrande_Whisperwind "Tyrande Whisperwind"), who neutralized her attackers.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the xref:KnightsOfTheEbonBlade.adoc[Knights of the Ebon Blade] and the [Argent Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argent_Crusade "Argent Crusade") in order to combat the returning enemy.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>

Lor'themar is later informed about the death of [Nathanos Blightcaller](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathanos_Blightcaller "Nathanos Blightcaller"), where his only regret is how he was unable to witness it personally. While not begrudging [Tyrande Whisperwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrande_Whisperwind "Tyrande Whisperwind") for claiming the killing blow, Lor'themar was worried and hoped that her rage remained fixed upon [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"). Upon hearing this [Calia Menethil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Calia_Menethil "Calia Menethil"), reminded him of how she had given counsel to the kaldorei who were raised into undeath after the battle for Darkshore. She further explained how she hoped to give them a path forward and to share this knowledge with Tyrande, would help ease her spirits, if only a little. In response, Lor'themar revealed that [Lilian Voss](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lilian_Voss "Lilian Voss") had informed him of her efforts and hoped that fate would offer her the chance to see her kin offer bear fruit.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>

Following the death of [Herald Dalora](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Herald_Dalora "Herald Dalora"), the champions returned to xref:Orgrimmar.adoc[Orgrimmar] to inform the council about the events that occurred in [Icecrown](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Icecrown "Icecrown") and the [dark powers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mawsworn "Mawsworn") that Sylvanas had allied with. Acknowledging that Sylvanas had taken Thrall, Baine, and the others beyond the shattered veil, Lor'themar vowed to send word to the Knights of the Ebon Blade, and devise a strategy to rescue them from [the realms of Death](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowlands "Shadowlands"). He then instructed the champions to remain vigilant, fight back the Scourge wherever they saw them encroaching, and promised to call upon them once a rescue plan was set in place.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>

### Shadowlands

Lor'themar was among the Horde leaders to convene with the leaders of the Alliance and [Bolvar Fordragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bolvar_Fordragon "Bolvar Fordragon") at the [Frozen Throne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Throne "Frozen Throne") within [Icecrown Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Icecrown_Citadel "Icecrown Citadel"). While desiring to rescue his friends, Lor'themar knew that he couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission. In light of [Tyrande Whisperwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrande_Whisperwind "Tyrande Whisperwind")'s hostility when he encouraged the Alliance to do the same, he prepared himself for battle but stood down when Bolvar called for it.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> He then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the [Maw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maw "Maw") and watched as [champions](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") of Azeroth, the xref:KnightsOfTheEbonBlade.adoc[Knights of the Ebon Blade], and even Tyrande Whisperwind enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> He subsequently departed from Icecrown.

After xref:MawWalker.adoc[Maw Walkers] freed Thrall and Baine from [Torghast](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Torghast,_Tower_of_the_Damned "Torghast, Tower of the Damned"), [Calia Menethil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Calia_Menethil "Calia Menethil")—who had gone with the heroes to the Shadowlands—sent word back to Lor'themar on Azeroth.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>

Baine and Lor'themar in the Crucible.

After the defeat of [the Jailer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zovaal "Zovaal"), Lor'themar and Thalyssra traveled to [Oribos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Oribos "Oribos") to attend Sylvanas Windrunner's trial,<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> which ended with Tyrande sending her to the Maw to free all of the souls trapped therein. Lor'themar expressed regret that he had stood by during the Banshee Queen's atrocities and reflected that judgment might come for him as well in the end. Before going home, Lor'themar and Baine stayed for a time in the [Crucible](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crucible_(Oribos) "Crucible (Oribos)") atop Oribos. Lor'themar asked the tauren if there were any souls he'd like to visit before he returned to Azeroth. Baine understood that Lor'themar was asking about his father [Cairne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof "Cairne Bloodhoof") and replied that he didn't need to, since he felt that Cairne's spirit was always with him. Baine then turned the question on Lor'themar, who stated that he'd always wondered if he was truly suited to lead the blood elves and that he'd like to visit the soul of [Prince Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider "Kael'thas Sunstrider"), to ask if he regretted the choices he'd made and get a chance to feel that the torch of leadership had truly been passed. Baine told his friend that he understood the feeling and wished him luck.<sup id="cite_ref-Penance_and_Renewal_83-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Penance_and_Renewal-83">[83]</a></sup>

Lor'themar also approached [King Genn Greymane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Genn_Greymane "Genn Greymane"), who had come to the Crucible as well, to tell him that he hoped Sylvanas' fate would bring the Alliance some peace. Genn replied that the regent lord should ask the souls of Sylvanas' victims if they felt peace and that peace was something he himself would never know as long as [his son](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Liam_Greymane "Liam Greymane")'s killer endured. He then sardonically asked Lor'themar if he hoped Sylvanas would come back from the Maw to serve as his ranger-general or warchief again. Lor'themar defended himself by saying that although he'd once admired Sylvanas as his hero and friend, the banshee that almost led the Horde to ruin had been neither of those things. Genn replied that, if so, Lor'themar shouldn't have followed her commands. The king and regent lord then curtly bid each other good day.<sup id="cite_ref-Penance_and_Renewal_83-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Penance_and_Renewal-83">[83]</a></sup>

Sometime after, Lor'themar returned to Azeroth, and there was a resurgence of [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") in [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas "Quel'Thalas").

However, Rommath countered that they couldn't wait and had to deal with the Scourge immediately. Liadrin agreed with Rommath's assessment and was able to convince Lor'themar that it would be best to call upon those still in training to hold the line and keep Quel'Thalas safe.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> After the [san'layn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/San%27layn "San'layn") [Vorath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vorath "Vorath") was slain and the Scourge beaten back, Lor'themar promised to inform the [Ebon Blade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ebon_Blade "Ebon Blade") of what transpired in Quel'Thalas, and he suspected that matters in xref:Northrend.adoc[Northrend] may even be worse.

### The Vow Eternal

A few years later, Lor'themar and Thalyssra invited a number of Azeroth's leaders to the wedding at the [Lunastre Estate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lunastre_Estate "Lunastre Estate") within [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar"). During the ceremony itself, they had [Lady Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin") serve as their official officiator and exchanged their vows through poetry. After [Kurog Grimtotem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kurog_Grimtotem "Kurog Grimtotem") caused a scene with [Wrathion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wrathion "Wrathion"), and was being kicked out, the Black Prince formally apologized to the newlyweds for his role in it. In response, Lor'themar declared that there was no need to apologize and brushed off the manner by joking about there being plenty of cake.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

The battle with Lor'themar, [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister_Rommath "Grand Magister Rommath"), and [Halduron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing") can be intimidating for a small raid, and is somewhat comparable to the [Council of Three Hammers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Three_Hammers "Council of Three Hammers") encounter. Rommath and Halduron can prove a serious threat to the raid, and killing all three may seem daunting at first. However, the [Royal Guards](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Guard_(blood_elf) "Royal Guard (blood elf)") have not been updated since WotLK, so they are dispatched quite easily. It is vital that the raid keep in mind that their respawn timers, like Garrosh Hellscream, are only 10 minutes, unlike other city leaders.

Raids should devote a few players to keeping an eye out for players teleporting in from behind Lor'themar's chamber as well as the mage trainer's room so as to be ready to quickly dispatch horde players who come to Lor'themar's aid from the Undercity and Pandaria respectively. Your tank should hold Lor'themar to one side of the room to give healers adequate distance to avoid Lor'themar's Mana Burn ability. PVP trinkets are a must for this fight in order to deal with Lor'themar's Mass Charm spell.

The combined HP levels of the three Silvermoon leaders can make this a long boss fight, their total HP pool nearly being 1.85B and with several mechanics to take into account for each boss. This is countered by players only needing to kill Lor'themar and the relatively low chance of a xref:Horde.adoc[Horde] defense force gaining swift knowledge of a Silvermoon raid. Thus, player interference is much less likely than in some of the more populated cities.

Halduron strikes swiftly when in melee range, and will periodically use a [Multi-shot](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Multi-shot "Multi-shot") ability similar to [Sylvanas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas "Sylvanas")', hitting up to ten members of the raid and will also hit random raid members with a regular [Shoot](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shoot "Shoot") ability. Rommath will rely on fire-based attacks -  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/93/Spell_fire_flamebolt.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20061125005238)[\[Fireball\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fireball) on his current target and  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e0/Spell_fire_selfdestruct.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20061223083951)[\[Flamestrike\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flamestrike) on a certain location, but is immune to any interrupts. Rommath's  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/d6/Ability_mage_moltenarmor.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20070114121706)[\[Molten Armor\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Armor) can be dispelled, but he will immediately recast it. Focussing on Halduron, Rommath, and Lor'themar respectively will allow more breathing space, as without Halduron and Rommath's abilities to consider, the battle drops in difficulty.

Like Halduron, Lor'themar strikes swiftly in melee range, and generally alternates between his  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e9/Ability_warrior_cleave.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20060928010105)[\[Cleave\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cleave) and Arcane Shock abilities. His  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/c7/Spell_shadow_manaburn.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20060928021112)[\[Mana Burn\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mana_Burn) has increased in potency, though he will only infrequently cast his Mass charm. With luck, subtlety, and enough concentrated DPS, Lor'themar will fall.

Lor'themar's downfall is the objective of   ![Alliance](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/2/21/Alliance_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20110509070714 "Alliance") ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e1/Achievement_leader_lorthemar_theron.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20180218134755)[\[Killed in Quel'Thalas\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Killed_in_Quel%27Thalas).

Lor'themar in the manga.

Lor'themar's appearance has changed considerably in each piece of media he has appeared in. For his debut in the _[Sunwell Trilogy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell_Trilogy "Sunwell Trilogy")_, Lor'themar was shown to sport a regal-looking outfit complete with outward shoulderplates, a longsword, and a rugged cape, fitting his role as a ranger commander. He had fairly long and slicked hair, and most notably was missing his left eye. During the _[Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Crusade "Burning Crusade")_, Lor'themar had undergone a drastic change of appearance - he now had two functional eyes, his hair was put into a topknot, and his attire was incredibly simplified. Lor'themar used a warglaive complete with a shield, both of which he had not been seen with prior.

In the _Battlecry mosaic_, Lor'themar's attire had completely changed once more - his outfit was painted as far more extravagant (also in mail or plate), with eagle portraits on his shoulders and decorated in a collage of red and gold. He was also seen holding a new shield, and its design was similar to the ones [Silvermoon City Guardians](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silvermoon_City_Guardian "Silvermoon City Guardian") are seen with. Here, he was also portrayed with a goatee.

During his debut in _[Tides of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_Darkness "Tides of Darkness")_, Lor'themar was described as having dark brown eyes and hair the color of corn-silk.<sup id="cite_ref-Tides_of_Darkness,_pg._228_88-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Tides_of_Darkness,_pg._228-88">[88]</a></sup> In the _Trading Card Game_, Lor'themar is depicted as a dark blonde, though all of his other appearances from the [Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Crusade "Burning Crusade") onwards show him with pale-white hair.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/d4/Lor%27themar%27s_Scar.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20181212051906)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/d4/Lor%27themar%27s_Scar.png/revision/latest?cb=20181212051906)

Lor'themar in [Tides of Vengeance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_Vengeance "Tides of Vengeance").

Lor'themar's model introduced for _[Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm")_ is again unlike his previous incarnations. It appears to be an elaborate and recolored mix of the final [rogue](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue "Rogue") and [mage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mage "Mage") [tier 6](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6") sets, found in the [Sunwell Plateau](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell_Plateau "Sunwell Plateau") raid. Though still of a strikingly different design, his _Cataclysm_ model seems to somewhat resemble his appearance in the mosaic. In [patch 8.1.0](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_8.1.0 "Patch 8.1.0"), Lor'themar obtained an entirely new model, unlike any art of him before.

The most logical reason for his changes of appearance in the lore can be put down to the strong clash of culture that Lor'themar has experienced - from a ranger, who fought from the front to protect his country, to a ruler now forced to play his hand at politics. His common attire being replaced by an outfit that exerts regality seems to illustrate this.

Finally, his official artwork for _[In the Shadow of the Sun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun "In the Shadow of the Sun")_ seems to combine aspects of all of his past appearances. His eye-scar is visibly noticeable, his outfit is truly resembling his in-game model ([blade included](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Greatsword_of_the_Sin%27dorei "Greatsword of the Sin'dorei")), and subtle parts of his _Battlecry Mosaic_ picture are carried over, such as the avian emblems emblazoned on his shoulders.

From his in-game introduction in _The Burning Crusade_ up until the launch patch of _Mists of Pandaria_, Lor'themar had two functioning eyes despite having only one in his depiction in _The Sunwell Trilogy._ An eyepatch was added to Lor'themar's model in patch 5.1, correcting the error after nearly six years. The eyepatch was soon after replaced with one based on the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/99/Inv_helmet_44.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20061011112325)[\[Jeweler's Ruby Monocle\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jeweler%27s_Ruby_Monocle), and at various points the eyepatch was mistakenly placed over his right eye.

In _Battle for Azeroth_ [patch 8.1](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_8.1 "Patch 8.1"), Lor'themar was given a unique, high definition model that displays his scar and blind eye as it appears in previous artwork, along with regal new attire consisting of golden armor with a phoenix motif worn over a red and gold surcoat. In [patch 8.2](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_8.2 "Patch 8.2"), he was additionally given a unique greatsword based on the one in his new concept art.

Lor'themar in the [Ghostlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghostlands "Ghostlands").

Lor'themar has become a ruler balancing a fierce love for his kingdom together with the weight of his peoples' burdens, though his responsibilities were not always so heavy. Years before his regency, Lor'themar was a patriotic and passionate ranger, with a talent for both battle and strategy. Lor'themar took pride in his role as a [Farstrider](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider "Farstrider") and a warden of the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell"), which the great traitor [Dar'Khan Drathir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dar%27Khan_Drathir "Dar'Khan Drathir") exploited for his own gain. Lor'themar holds guilt for his inability to see through Dar'Khan's betrayal, and his early years as regent were marked by several hard decisions and many difficult battles to bring his people back from the brink. Theron was hit hard by the betrayal of Prince [Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas "Kael'thas"), with the future of Quel'Thalas falling into his hands alone. This experience has led him to oppose tyranny and injustice wherever he finds it, always putting the good of his people first.<sup id="cite_ref-UVG_5-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-UVG-5">[5]</a></sup>

As the regent lord of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar has become highly versed in the world of politics, able to quickly deduce hidden meanings and often see through the masks of those within (and out of) his sphere of influence. Though authoritative (and not afraid to exert that authority), Lor'themar values the opinions of [his](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron "Halduron") [advisors](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath"), in matters of state and beyond. The life of a politician is not something Lor'themar ever craved, however; ever the ranger at heart, Lor'themar enjoys a good fight, longs for his lost life as a Farstrider, and finds politics exhausting.

Lor'themar places the safety of Quel'Thalas and its people high above all else. Lor'themar's loyalty is clear in this regard: he will not suffer allies who would harm his people, and will not shy from [negotiating with his enemies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance") or [plotting rebellion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_Rebellion "Darkspear Rebellion") to secure his people a future.

Though the burdens of leadership have weighed heavily on Lor'themar's shoulders in the wake of Prince Kael'thas' betrayal, under his leadership Quel'Thalas has survived many of its darkest days. He has resolved to see his people overcome their struggles, and lead them into a prosperous future.<sup id="cite_ref-us.battle.net_11-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-us.battle.net-11">[11]</a></sup>

Lor'themar doesn't have a family, nor does he want to start a new dynasty.<sup id="cite_ref-UVG_5-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-UVG-5">[5]</a></sup> He was implied to be romantically interested in [Lady Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin"), with whom he has shared several close moments; Liadrin, in turn, has some amorous feelings toward the regent.<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup> However, he later fell in love with [Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_Arcanist_Thalyssra "First Arcanist Thalyssra").<sup id="cite_ref-AMiV_73-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-AMiV-73">[73]</a></sup> He considers [Halduron Brightwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing") his closest and most trusted friend,<sup id="cite_ref-Blood_of_the_Highborne_4-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Blood_of_the_Highborne-4">[4]</a></sup> and is on far better terms with [Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rommath "Rommath") than he was before their prince's betrayal.<sup id="cite_ref-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun_7-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun-7">[7]</a></sup> Lor'themar is more than capable of playing the part of the statesman, unnerving others with how well he controls his thoughts and masks his meanings;<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> but in much of _[Blood of the Highborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_of_the_Highborne "Blood of the Highborne")_, the _[Sunwell Trilogy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell_Trilogy "Sunwell Trilogy")_, and _[Mists of Pandaria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mists_of_Pandaria "Mists of Pandaria")_–when he isn't playing politics–he is shown to be passionate, outspoken, and with a dry wit.

According to [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw"), he is a calm and steady individual and describes him as a reliable leader as Regent Lord, a master diplomat, and a shrewd negotiator who always has the best interests of his people at heart. He also noted that it is easy to underestimate him, but that would be a grievous mistake.<sup id="cite_ref-Exploring_Azeroth_90-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Exploring_Azeroth-90">[90]</a></sup>

Lor'themar's journal

_Journal of the Regent Lord, entry 83_

_I cannot remember the last time I told anyone such a bald-faced lie, even since I was forced into politics. But I did lie to [Aethas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas "Aethas"), and he knows it, and I know it, and anyone who heard me say it knows it. My will means very little, in fact. I can pretend my power is real, but in the end, it is all an act, and none of it is honest. I can wash my hands of it, play martyr, be victimized, and accomplish nothing, or I can fight and victimize others in my turn and thus become the essence of all I have battled. If I have ever rationalized my choices using any other logic, I was certainly lying to myself. [Hawkspear](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Renthar_Hawkspear "Renthar Hawkspear") was right: I deal with the devil indeed, but the [Sunwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") may never have been restored had we not sunk to those levels. He and Aurora can sleep soundly, knowing they have never compromised their ethics, but if they deny that they prosper in the wake of those who have, then they delude themselves as much as I._

_Here I find myself so close to believing that the ends justify the means. But the ruins of the [Magisters' Terrace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magisters%27_Terrace "Magisters' Terrace") will haunt me forever, reminding me of the fate I tempt with that thought. This is the line I walk, finally knowing that the actions I take in necessity are nonetheless indefensible. Those truths can never be reconciled, but sometimes I can hold them both side by side and almost understand. I might call this revelation profound if I were ignorant enough not to realize that I am only learning what [Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas "Kael'thas"), and [Anasterian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anasterian "Anasterian") before him, had also learned in their turns. All we can do is walk the road we are given with such dignity as we can muster, each to our own glory or demise, and pray that there yet remains something of our own hearts when all is said and done. By the Sunwell, I hope that there will remain something of mine._

Let it serve as a lesson to us all as we move forward to our prosperous future.

Like our people, the Horde is always in motion, always changing. But make no mistake. We will endure.

-   Queen's champion or no, I can out-shoot Nathanos any day of the week.

#### Gossip

Mogujia

-   Has our loyalty not been tested and proven, time and again? All I hear from our Warchief's mouth are falsehoods and excuses.
-   Garrosh spouts on about honor and strength, but in truth our leader sees only two outcomes - either fight and survive, or be defeated and forgotten.
-   There is a difference between testing one's strength and blindly walking into harm's way. Garrosh sent us to do the latter, and this I cannot accept.
-   I brought my people here at Garrosh's request. Little did I realize we were to be sacrificed like pawns in a game.

Valley of Emperors initial

Mogu are imperious, arrogant, and powerful - all characteristics that will send Garrosh into a rage when he arrives.

This is why it is critical that we capture and interrogate the leader of these mogu before that happens.

Valley of Emperors later

<Name> - good work. Without your assistance, I'm afraid this whole business would have ended quite nastily.

On this island I must ask you to face great dangers. Your loyalty and trust are appreciated, <name>.

Hmph. I have survived worse odds.

Tidal Conflux

-   The Tidestone of Golganneth is safe for now. We will guard it until we are ready to assault the palace.
-   While we cannot fully trust the Alliance, we will need all the help we can get. Azshara will not show mercy to us once we enter her palace.
-   There is still much work to be done, <name>.
-   We are very nearly finished. Only one obstacle remains.

A part of will always wonder if this would have happened had I acted sooner. If I had confronted Sylvanas in the early days of the war. If [Teldrassil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Teldrassil "Teldrassil") hadn't burned.

It is not an easy thing to watch a friend tread down a dark path, to recognize when they have gone astray. I thought I knew her, and Saurfang paid the price for my error in judgement.

I have tasked the Farstriders with tracking down both Sylvanas and Nathanos... though I am unsure we find them at all. They were Farstriders themselves, once.

But I cannot simply stand idle while they are out there. Not anymore.

We sin'dorei are no strangers to suffering and tragedy. I have seen my people [massacred](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge_invasion_of_Quel%27Thalas "Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas"), my kingdom razed, and [all I revere](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunwell "Sunwell") defiled.

When Silvermoon at last rejoined the world, it was Sylvanas who extended her hand and welcomed us into the Horde.

Those days are long behind us now. The devastation and loss inflicted upon Azeroth by the Banshee Queen is nigh incalculable.

The knowledge that I stood by while so much of it happened still haunts me. Perhaps, in the end, judgment will come for me as well.

_Lor'themar walks over to Genn._

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Well met, King Greymane.

**Genn Greymane says:** Regent Lord.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** I hope the fate of Sylvanas Windrunner brings the Alliance some measure of peace.

**Genn Greymane says:** Peace? You stand in the Shadowlands, Regent Lord. Ask the dead she sent here whether they feel peace.

**Genn Greymane says:** As for me, that's something I will never know. Not while the monster who killed [my son](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Liam_Greymane "Liam Greymane") still endures.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** I understand. My people are haunted by the deeds of monsters as well.

**Genn Greymane says:** And what of you? Are you hoping that the ranger-general you served comes back from the Maw? Or would you prefer having your warchief again?

**Lor'themar Theron says:** I spent most of my life alongside the Windrunner family. Sylvanas was my hero... and my friend. But the banshee who nearly led the Horde to ruin was neither.

**Genn Greymane says:** Then you shouldn't have followed her commands. Good day, Regent Lord.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Good day, King Greymane.

_Lor'themar walks back to his old spot._

Dialogue with [Baine Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof") (triggered by talking to Baine)

**Lor'themar Theron says:** To think we now stand on the other side of the [veil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Veil "Veil"). That those we lost await us here among these countless afterlives.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Is there... anyone you would seek out, Baine? For one last conversation before you return to the land of the living?

**Baine Bloodhoof says:** No need to spare my feelings, Lor'themar. You are asking if I wish to find [my father](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof "Cairne Bloodhoof").

**Baine Bloodhoof says:** The truth is... I do not need to. His spirit is always with me, wherever I go, whatever I do. Guiding me just as his ancestors guided him.

**Baine Bloodhoof says:** And what of you? Is there someone you would visit, given this chance?

**Lor'themar Theron says:** [Prince Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider "Kael'thas Sunstrider"). Long have I held the title of Regent Lord, all the while wondering if I was truly suited to lead my people.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** I would ask the last liege of Silvermoon if he regrets the choices he made. A chance to mend old wounds, and perhaps feel that the torch has truly been passed.

**Baine Bloodhoof says:** A feeling I understand all too well. I pray your conversation brings you the peace you seek, my friend.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Several years have passed quietly since our forces returned from the Shadowlands. But it seems that quiet is now at an end, my love.

**First Arcanist Thalyssra says:** Indeed. We were fortunate to have even a brief respite from the usual perils and tribulations.

**First Arcanist Thalyssra says:** Otherwise, you might have come up with an excuse to refuse my proposal.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Your proposal? I am quite certain it was I who begged for your hand in marriage, Thalyssra.

**First Arcanist Thalyssra says:** Lor'themar Theron! You are such a creature of duty that you would have delayed our wedding over a crooked painting in Silvermoon.

**First Arcanist Thalyssra says:** How fortunate I am that both our kingdoms witnessed our vows. Else you might try to deny that we ever exchanged them.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Deny the happiest moment of my life? Never.

**Lor'themar Theron says:** Whether under the light of the sun or the rays of the moon, I will love you for all my days, Thalyssra.

**First Arcanist Thalyssra says:** As I will love you. No matter how many dragons try to distract us.

In the expansion's lore, Lor'themar leads the [blood elvens](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_elf "Blood elf") against a second invasion of [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas "Quel'Thalas") by the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge"), lead by [The Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lich_King "The Lich King") himself.

-   At some point, he fought beside [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw").<sup id="cite_ref-Exploring_Azeroth_90-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-Exploring_Azeroth-90">[90]</a></sup>
-   Lor'themar ordered a revitalization of [spellbreaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spellbreaker "Spellbreaker") training some time following _The Burning Crusade_, leading to a resurgence of Spellbreakers among the blood elves' ranks.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>
-   Apparently, Lor'themar's personal residence is not within [Sunfury Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunfury_Spire "Sunfury Spire"). Though, he has been described as spending more time there than in "his own home."
-   [Tak-tak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tak-tak "Tak-tak") the kite-master contrasted Garrosh with Lor'themar, stating that while the former is all about strength, the latter is all about strategy. The hozen has some difficulty with Lor'themar's name.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>
-   An excerpt from Lor'themar's journal was used in the _[Archive of the Tirisgarde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archive_of_the_Tirisgarde "Archive of the Tirisgarde")_, in which Lor'themar gives an account of the day he showed Prince [Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas "Kael'thas") to the body of his slain [father](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anasterian_Sunstrider "Anasterian Sunstrider") and the Sunstriders' shattered runeblade,  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/48/Inv_sword_1h_artifactfelomelorn_d_01.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20160801223428)[\[Felo'melorn\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felo%27melorn). Lor'themar was left to ponder what legacy, if any, would await his people and the blade he felt now represented not power and dominance, but fallibility.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>
    -   Lor'themar's journal-keeping has been mentioned in a few other sources in addition to this. In _[In the Shadow of the Sun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun "In the Shadow of the Sun")_, he used it to reflect upon the leadership of the previous lieges of Silvermoon. In _[A Moment in Verse](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A_Moment_in_Verse "A Moment in Verse")_, he used it to jot down inspirations and verse for his poetry. In _[Shadows Rising](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_Rising "Shadows Rising")_, his writings were spied upon by [SI:7](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/SI:7 "SI:7"), who gleaned no insight into the Horde's politics but did observe a veiled reference to Lor'themar's relationship with [Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalyssra "Thalyssra"): _"My dusk lily bends more each day towards the sun."_
-   Lor'themar Theron's impaled body can be seen in the [Stormwind Harbor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_Harbor "Stormwind Harbor") of the [Realm of Y'Shaarj](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Realm_of_Y%27Shaarj "Realm of Y'Shaarj").
-   When Lor'themar first appeared in _[The Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade")_, his title was of the Regent Lord. [The former Characters of Warcraft section](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Characters_of_Warcraft/Lor%27themar_Theron "The Characters of Warcraft/Lor'themar Theron") and _[World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 3](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Chronicle_Volume_3 "World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 3")_ state that Kael appointed Lor'themar as Regent Lord. However, in _[Blood of the Highborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_of_the_Highborne "Blood of the Highborne")_, set before the events of _The Burning Crusade_, he is called regent. And [the Warcraft Encyclopedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Warcraft_Encyclopedia/Blood_Elves "The Warcraft Encyclopedia/Blood Elves") states that Lor'themar Theron was appointed regent. The [Ultimate Visual Guides](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ultimate_Visual_Guide "Ultimate Visual Guide") say that Theron was appointed Regent and became Regent Lord later after Kael'thas' final death.
-   Lor'themar was present in [Orgrimmar Embassy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrimmar_Embassy "Orgrimmar Embassy") in the first build of [patch 7.3.5](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_7.3.5 "Patch 7.3.5") PTR.
-   In his first appearance in the trading card game, Lor'themar is portrayed as a paladin, though nothing in the lore has suggested he is one. However, this might be because of blood elves being the first Horde race to have paladins (the [Blood Knights](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Knight "Blood Knight")), and Lor'themar was listed as a "paladin (Blood Knight)" to emphasize this. Similarly, [Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Velen "Velen") is a [shaman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman "Shaman") in the card game despite being a [priest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Priest "Priest") in lore.
    -   This appears to have been addressed in the _Tomb of the Forgotten_ TCG series, in which both Lor'themar and Velen reprise their roles, though with slightly more accurate classes: Lor'themar is touted as a [hunter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter "Hunter"), while Velen is noted as a [priest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Priest "Priest").
-   In-game, Lor'themar's fighting style (melee combat with anti-magic abilities) is far more akin to a [spellbreaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spellbreaker "Spellbreaker") than a ranger or warrior. He, however, isn't a spellbreaker.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>
-   A quote of Lor'themar's directed at [Lady Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Sylvanas_Windrunner "Lady Sylvanas Windrunner"), "There is no choice here, Sylvanas," was spoken by Kael'thas to [Lady Vashj](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Vashj "Lady Vashj") in the exact same manner within the [Dungeons of Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeons_of_Dalaran "Dungeons of Dalaran"): "There is no choice here, Vashj." This is perhaps a nod to the blurring lines between Theron and Kael, as noted by Rommath.
-   According to [Micky Neilson](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Micky_Neilson "Micky Neilson"), the _[Blood of the Highborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_of_the_Highborne "Blood of the Highborne")_ novella's first chapter was originally meant<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> to take place during the [Troll Wars](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Troll_Wars "Troll Wars"),<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> which would have made both Lor'themar and Zul'jin around 3,000 years old. This seems dubious as trolls haven't been known to live that long. In  ![H](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/c4/Horde_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20201010153315) \[60\] [Old Allies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Allies), Lor'themar states that he has respected Sylvanas for millennia.
-   Though he seems to have spent much of his life as a [ranger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_ranger "Elven ranger"), iconically fond of bows, Lor'themar seems to prefer very close range or melee combat. He was seen fighting with a sword in the _Sunwell Trilogy_, and also used a spear/shield combo in _[Tides of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_Darkness "Tides of Darkness")_, making him more of a [Warrior](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warrior "Warrior") archetype, rather than the [Hunter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter "Hunter"), which is often associated with [elven rangers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_ranger "Elven ranger"). Interestingly, his surname Theron translates as "hunter" in Greek.
-   Even though he lost an eye and got a scar right above it during the Scourge invasion of Silvermoon in the Sunwell Trilogy comic, he still appears to have two eyes and a scarless face in World of Warcraft. This was finally fixed in [patch 5.1](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_5.1 "Patch 5.1"), which added an eyepatch to Lor'themar's model.
    -   In the mosaic, Lor'themar seems to have two functional eyes and scarless face again. It is likely this is just a mistake on Blizzard's part as it is unlikely Lor'themar's eye was healed to be functional again.
        -   In more recent art his eye is visibly scarred over again, and his remaining one is referred to as "his good eye."<sup id="cite_ref-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun_7-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun-7">[7]</a></sup>
        -   Strangely enough, in his appearance at the [Siege of Orgrimmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Orgrimmar_(instance) "Siege of Orgrimmar (instance)") instance he is wearing both, his eyepatch and later his monocle. In the [Vault of Y'Shaarj](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_of_Y%27Shaarj "Vault of Y'Shaarj") and the [Inner Sanctum](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Inner_Sanctum_(Siege_of_Orgrimmar) "Inner Sanctum (Siege of Orgrimmar)") of the [Underhold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Underhold "Underhold") he has the eyepatch on his right eye. In the [Bladefist Bay](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bladefist_Bay "Bladefist Bay") he wears a monocle, despite having an eyepatch before teleporting here.
        -   As of [patch 7.3.5](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_7.3.5 "Patch 7.3.5"), he once again wears the eyepatch on his right eye, in [Sunfury Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunfury_Spire "Sunfury Spire"). However, during a scene in the nightborne questline, he has the monocle where it should be. Unfortunately, the eye can be seen behind it.
            -   In the same patch, Lor'themar received new voice-lines and one of the lines says that he would never switch sides of his eyepatch.
        -   To put the issue to rest, his new unique character model does not have an eye patch or a monocle at all. Instead, his left eye is scarred over and blinded.
-   Lor'themar Theron is the [racial leader](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Racial_leader "Racial leader") of the blood elves in World of Warcraft. Out of all racial leaders, his model was the least unique until Cataclysm.
-   Like [Garrosh Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh_Hellscream "Garrosh Hellscream"), Lor'themar does not have the usual two-hour respawn timer upon being killed by an Alliance raid instead, he respawns (along with Halduron and Rommath) roughly 5–10 minutes following his death.
-   Lor'themar was the main character of the fan story _[In the Shadow of the Sun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun "In the Shadow of the Sun")_, which won the grand prize in Blizzard's first global creative writing contest.<sup id="cite_ref-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun_7-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-In_the_Shadow_of_the_Sun-7">[7]</a></sup> The story has since been accepted as official lore by Blizzard and has been put forward as Lor'themar's tale in the faction leader short stories series with minor alterations.<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>
-   Lor'themar is one of the few racial leaders to have fully voiced dialogue for each aspect of his [faction leader](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Faction_leader "Faction leader") battle, along with [Baine Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof"), [Trade Prince Gallywix](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Prince_Gallywix "Trade Prince Gallywix"), the [Council of Three Hammers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Three_Hammers "Council of Three Hammers") and [Genn Greymane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Genn_Greymane "Genn Greymane").
    -   After wiping an Alliance raid, as well as playing the "raid wipe" soundbite, Lor'themar will announce his victory speech in [yell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yell "Yell") text; only [Cairne Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof "Cairne Bloodhoof") was known to do so before Theron.
-   In _[The Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade")_, Lor'themar originally wielded a simple warglaive and a shield matching those used by [Farstrider Scouts](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farstrider_Scout "Farstrider Scout"). Beginning in _[Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "World of Warcraft: Cataclysm")_ he was depicted with a  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/13/Inv_weapon_shortblade_98.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20090327224651)[\[Greatsword of the Sin'dorei\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Greatsword_of_the_Sin%27dorei), which he wielded one-handed. As of [patch 8.2](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_8.2 "Patch 8.2"), Lor'themar wields his own unique sword.
-   Lor'themar Theron was voiced by [Dave Mallow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dave_Mallow "Dave Mallow") until [patch 5.1.0](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_5.1.0 "Patch 5.1.0"). He is now voiced by [Gideon Emery](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gideon_Emery "Gideon Emery").

-   Towards the conclusion of his political negotiations with the xref:Horde.adoc[Horde], Lor'themar mentioned that [Grand Magister Rommath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magister_Rommath "Grand Magister Rommath") had received word back from [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland")—and that the answer to one of [Thrall's](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") questions was, with great certainty, "yes."<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> The content of this question has not been confirmed, though considering the context, it could be that Rommath had confirmed the presence of [uncorrupted orcs](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mag%27har_orc "Mag'har orc") still active on Draenor. This may have been a key bargaining chip during Lor'themar and Sylvanas' attempts to ensure the sin'dorei an equal place in the Horde. Lor'themar later mentioned that the blood elves could be a vital link to "Thrall's people," further supporting this theory.
-   Lor'themar may have been a noble of sorts even before his ascension to regent; Lor'themar was introduced in _[Tides of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_Darkness "Tides of Darkness")_ as _Lord_ Theron. It may have been a simple term of endearment ([the speaker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner"), with whom Lor'themar shared a rank, was also a friend of his), or warranted by Lor'themar's status as Sylvanas' second-in-command.
-   Since the [Sunfury](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sunfury "Sunfury") have returned to Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar may have become their leader.
