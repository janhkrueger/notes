**Khadgar** is perhaps the most accomplished of all living [wizards](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard "Wizard")<sup id="cite_ref-WoDofficial_8-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-WoDofficial-8">[8]</a></sup> and one of the most powerful [magi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magi "Magi") in [Azerothian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth") history.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Khadgar currently acts as the leader of the [Kirin Tor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kirin_Tor "Kirin Tor"). He was an apprentice to the [Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal") [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"), until he helped defeat his possessed master. Though he was prematurely aged into an old man long ago, Khadgar nevertheless has been an exemplar for the [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance"), destroying the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") in the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War"), leading the [Alliance Expedition](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Expedition "Alliance Expedition") to [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor"), and counterattacking against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") and all who would threaten his world with annihilation.

While a hero of the Alliance, Khadgar is willing to work with the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") for the greater good of Azeroth.<sup id="cite_ref-DKt1_9-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-DKt1-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> As a member of the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six"), Khadgar hopes to drive the politics out of the Kirin Tor,<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and has been known to clash with the more [partisan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") members of the council.

During [the events](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_in_Draenor "War in Draenor") on the alternate [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor_(alternate_universe) "Draenor (alternate universe)"), he led the forces of the Alliance and the Horde to shut down the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal_(alternate_universe) "Dark Portal (alternate universe)"), and later worked with them to cripple the [Iron Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Horde "Iron Horde") in various areas of the world. He focused heavily on combating [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)") and the [Shadow Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Council_(alternate_universe) "Shadow Council (alternate universe)"), mostly by working alongside the [faction commanders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") and empowering them through a legendary ring of power.

Returning to Azeroth, Khadgar tried to prevent Gul'dan from opening the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras") but was forced to witness helplessly as the portal formed and the Legion poured through. He quickly informed important leaders of Azeroth of the impending [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") invasion. Though the factions of Azeroth rallied to combat the demonic threat and attempt to reseal the portal, their armies were defeated at the [Battle for the Broken Shore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_the_Broken_Shore "Battle for the Broken Shore").

Knowing that the combined forces of the greatest champions of Azeroth are necessary to succeed in resealing the portal, Khadgar made a plea to the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six") to readmit the Horde back into the Kirin Tor in order to fight the demons at full strength. The leader of the Kirin Tor at the time, [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"), was in opposition to this, but the Council put the matter to a vote and the majority voted against her. In response, Jaina left the Kirin Tor, unable to condone the Council's decision. Khadgar assumed leadership of the Kirin Tor after Jaina's departure and coordinated the campaign on the [Broken Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Isles "Broken Isles").

## Biography

### Apprenticeship with Medivh

Khadgar seeing a vision while in [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan").

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/4a/Young_Khadgar_1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/110?cb=20160731194422)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/4a/Young_Khadgar_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160731194422)

Khadgar during the fight with [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"), before his unnatural aging.

At the young age of 17, Khadgar was sent by the [Kirin Tor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kirin_Tor "Kirin Tor") to apprentice under the wizard [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh") in his tower at [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan"). Having traveled from Kul Tiras via a ship, he got to Karazhan where Medivh's servant, [Moroes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Moroes "Moroes"), was already waiting for him. At first, Khadgar believed Medivh to be nothing more than he appeared to be — a kindly, old, if slightly eccentric and curious wizard. After Medivh asked Khadgar everything about the Kirin Tor, Medivh ordered him to clean up the library, as he had with his previous apprentices - dozens of them, none of which lasted for more than a few days.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> While wandering in the tower, Khadgar found a room where he saw visions of a human army led by an old, long white-haired mage battling against creatures with green skins and black armors. Khadgar was surprised to see that the mage's eyes looked like his own. Another day, as Khadgar was sorting books, Medivh returned to his tower and attacked him, thinking that Khadgar was a thief — Medivh had forgotten that Khadgar was still there. Medivh apologized and together they went atop of the tower. By touching his head, Medivh taught Khadgar how to ride a gryphon and they went to explore the southern part of the kingdom: the [Black Morass](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Morass "Black Morass"). There he made his first contact with the orcs and warlocks such as [Nothgrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nothgrin "Nothgrin").

Medivh and Khadgar soon crossed paths with the King's Champion [Anduin Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Lothar "Anduin Lothar") and his soldiers on a scouting mission to the Black Morass. Lothar had encouraged his friend to rejoin Stormwind's defense, though understood that Medivh struggled with the power he unleashed on the [Gurubashi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_tribe "Gurubashi tribe") years ago. The Guardian played along and feigned a fear of tapping into unwieldy magical powers, though his true intention was to buy time for the Horde to gain power. Lothar also spoke with Khadgar, telling him about Medivh's troubled past and asking him to act as a caretaker in addition to an apprentice. Medivh became more erratic afterward, disappearing for days at a time and being exhausted when he finally returned.<sup id="cite_ref-WoWCV2121_15-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-WoWCV2121-15">[15]</a></sup>

After returning to Karazhan, Medivh left Khadgar alone in the tower. Khadgar continued studying and preparing for a [special spell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing "Farseeing"). When he thought the spell was completed, he used it and witnessed the epic battle between [Aegwynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegwynn "Aegwynn") and Sargeras. Medivh later returned so Khadgar could accompany him to [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind "Stormwind") to investigate the deaths of [Hugarin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hugarin "Hugarin") and [Huglar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Huglar "Huglar").

Khadgar discovered Medivh was actually a [Guardian of Tirisfal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal"), a lineage of incredibly powerful wizards empowered by a council to combat the forces of the Burning Legion. Soon after he began to sense something was drastically wrong with his master, though he never suspected that Medivh was actually being controlled by [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras"), the Dark [Titan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan"), he became suspicious of his master's actions and motives.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

After meeting a [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Horde "Old Horde") emissary, the [half-orc](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Half-orc "Half-orc") assassin [Garona](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garona "Garona"), Khadgar unraveled Medivh's plot to open a portal between [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth") and [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor"). Knowing it was already too late to stop the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") from opening further, Khadgar and Garona rushed to King [Llane Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Llane_Wrynn "Llane Wrynn") of Azeroth for help. The pair, along with Lord Anduin Lothar and a group of soldiers, returned to Karazhan and entered its [lower part](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lower_Karazhan "Lower Karazhan") to find Medivh in psychic link with the orc [warlock](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock "Warlock") [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan "Gul'dan"). Khadgar fought and managed to best his master and Sargeras by plunging a sword into Medivh's heart, but not before having his life and magical energy sucked out of him.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> By the end of the events of _[The Last Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Guardian "The Last Guardian")_, Khadgar had gone from a young adult to a frail old man. Sargeras, possessing Medivh, had tried to rip his soul from his body, nearly killing him in the assault, but instead drained part of his life force.<sup id="cite_ref-wowcv2_18-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-wowcv2-18">[18]</a></sup> After the death of his master, he buried the remains of Medivh, Moroes, and the [Cook](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cook "Cook") behind the tower. After it was done, he finally recognized the vision which had been following him since he first entered the tower — the future-Medivh that was about to collect Karazhan's energies for [next battle](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Third_War "Third War") against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion").

Khadgar in _[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness "Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness")_

Following Medivh's death and the fall of [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind "Stormwind") to the orcs, Khadgar [fled north](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Refugee#Exodus_of_Stormwind "Refugee") with Lord Lothar and the rest of the refugees to [Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron "Lordaeron"). His magic returned to him over time (far stronger than it had been before), but his youth did not. While he retained the endurance, strength and agility of a young man, his appearance remained that of an old man with a lined face and stark white hair.<sup id="cite_ref-ToD10_19-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-ToD10-19">[19]</a></sup> Khadgar's presence helped lend weight to Lothar's testimony about the rest of the kingdoms aligning together to fight against the coming [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde"). He was also surprised to learn that Lothar hailed from the ancient Arathi bloodline.

With the formation of the [Alliance of Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_of_Lordaeron "Alliance of Lordaeron") secured, Khadgar was called to meet the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six") of Dalaran, where he revealed the truth regarding his apprenticeship to Medivh. Additionally, he revealed that he planned to aid Lothar and the Alliance in their battles against the Horde threat. Recognizing that Khadgar would follow his own course regardless of their counsel, the archmages gave him leave to go, and appointed him their official liaison to Lothar. He then joined Lothar and witnessed the birth of the [Silver Hand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_Hand "Silver Hand"). During this time a newly made paladin by the name of [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") developed a rapport with Khadgar, who despite his aged appearance, was roughly the same age as the paladin.

Khadgar fought at Lothar's side for the first [skirmishes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Hillsbrad_Foothills "Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills") at [Hillsbrad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hillsbrad_Fields "Hillsbrad Fields") and [Southshore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Southshore "Southshore"). After forcing the Horde from their initial beach landing, the Alliances forces followed the Horde northeast to the mountain pass leading to the [Wildhammer dwarves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wildhammer_dwarf "Wildhammer dwarf")' keep of [Aerie Peak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aerie_Peak "Aerie Peak"). Unknown to the trailing Alliance forces, the Horde's goal was not the dwarven stronghold there. It was merely a feint to lure the bulk of their pursuers into a cat-and-mouse diversion in the mountains and forests of the [Hinterlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hinterlands "Hinterlands"), while the main body of the Horde marched on the elven homeland of [Quel'Thalas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Quel%27Thalas "Quel'Thalas"). From this location, the Horde could launch an assault on either [Silvermoon City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silvermoon_City "Silvermoon City") or [Stromgarde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stromgarde_(kingdom) "Stromgarde (kingdom)"). After realizing the Horde's true intentions, Lothar sent Turalyon, Khadgar, and Alleria to intercept the Horde before Quel'Thalas burned.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> The army was ferried from below [Stromgarde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stromgarde "Stromgarde") to an area near [Stratholme](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stratholme "Stratholme") and continued to the border of Quel'Thalas. The Horde proceeded and set fire to [Eversong Forest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eversong_Forest "Eversong Forest") in southern Quel'Thalas.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

The Allied forces managed to halt the Horde's advance into inner Quel'Thalas, but at the cost of many lives and a sizable portion of the [Eversong Forest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eversong_Forest "Eversong Forest") being destroyed. However, the Horde's wanton destruction and brutal assault on their home had convinced the elves to throw their full support behind the Alliance. When Khadgar finally left Quel'Thalas, it was at the head of an elven armada. They arrived at the [Capital City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_City "Capital City"), after passing through the mountainous region of [Alterac](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alterac_Mountains "Alterac Mountains"), just in time to turn back [Doomhammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrim_Doomhammer "Orgrim Doomhammer")'s siege, and then chased the orcs back to the beaches of Southshore.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

As the Horde retreated further south the two Alliance armies finally reconnected and marched south after them. When the two forces clashed, the Warchief of the Horde, [Orgrim Doomhammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrim_Doomhammer "Orgrim Doomhammer"), eventually fought and killed Anduin Lothar. Instead of shattering the Alliance's resolve as Doomhammer intended, the Alliance rallied under Turalyon and the bulk of the Horde was defeated. The Alliance forces continued south towards the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") and defeated the remnants of the Horde gathered there. Having studied Medivh's spells and the nature of the Dark Portal, Khadgar was able to destroy it, effectively severing the link between Azeroth and Draenor and cutting off Horde's reinforcements. The rift between worlds remained, however.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> To guard against a second attack from Draenor, Khadgar oversaw the construction of [Nethergarde Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nethergarde_Keep "Nethergarde Keep") in the [Blasted Lands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blasted_Lands "Blasted Lands").<sup id="cite_ref-Archmage_Khadgar_6-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-Archmage_Khadgar-6">[6]</a></sup>

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/77/KhadgarDarkPortalW2.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20070430071600)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/77/KhadgarDarkPortalW2.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20070430071600)

Khadgar closes the Dark Portal.

Khadgar's fears would be validated only a year after Nethergarde's completion, when the portal opened again, and orc forces began pouring out, striking strategically to steal powerful artifacts. While fighting the orcs, [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") suggested he'd get some food and rest. During his sleep, Khadgar had a particular dream. He was a giant running in the middle of Lordaeron, with the young appearance he had before being aged by [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras"). When he noticed Dalaran, he ran towards and slowly began to shrink. When he touched the pavement, he was at his normal size again. There he entered the [The Violet Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Violet_Citadel "The Violet Citadel"), where a dinner with a host awaited him. It was [Antonidas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antonidas "Antonidas"), warning him that the [Eye of Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Dalaran "Eye of Dalaran") was stolen. Antonidas promoted Khadgar to the rank of archmage and placed him in a position of authority over the mission to enter the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") and investigate [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

Realizing the havoc the Horde could bring, the Alliance launched [an expedition](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Expedition "Alliance Expedition") to the [orc homeworld](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor") headed by Khadgar. In Draenor, Khadgar quickly discovered that the situation was even worse than he had feared. The orcs, under the leadership of the [shaman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman "Shaman") [Ner'zhul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ner%27zhul "Ner'zhul"), were planning on opening doorways to new worlds for the Horde to plunder. During the Sons of Lothar attack on [Hellfire Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hellfire_Citadel "Hellfire Citadel"), Khadgar entered into a duel of honor with [Dentarg](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dentarg "Dentarg"). Dentarg's magic couldn't strike through Khadgar's defenses, and when Dentarg sent his most powerful spell Khadgar merely absorbed it into his palm and was refreshed by it. Accepting his defeat against a more powerful sorcerer, he bowed his head and Khadgar decapitated him.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_25-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-ReferenceA-25">[25]</a></sup>

Moving from there Khadgar and his fellows sought the [Skull of Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_of_Gul%27dan "Skull of Gul'dan"), finding it in [Deathwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing")'s possession and to this end they form an alliance with [Gruul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gruul_the_Dragonkiller "Gruul the Dragonkiller") against the [Black Dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Dragonflight "Black Dragonflight"). After that, Gruul and his ogre minions, along with the heroes, challenged Deathwing from his perch in Blade's Edge Mountains — killing his eggs and impaling his lesser black drakes on the mountain spikes. Infuriated by this act, Deathwing landed on top of them and attacked Gruul. Although clearly no match for the mad Aspect's power, Gruul was saved by Khadgar's miraculuous spell when he disassembled some of the adamantium plates that were holding Deathwing's unstable body together resulting in Deathwing's retreat. Honoring his word Gruul allowed the Alliance to leave unharmed, which they did so with the Skull of Gul'dan now in Khadgar's possession.

However, the [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Expedition "Alliance Expedition") forces ultimately failed to stop Ner'zhul from opening and escaping into his portals, and the subsequent chaotic energy the portals released began to destroy the planet. However in an act of last defiance against the dying [Obris](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Obris "Obris") (who had been betrayed by Ner'zhul) handed over the [Book of Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Medivh "Book of Medivh"), which he had been entrusted with, to Khadgar. To prevent the potential destruction of Azeroth, the archmage used [Medivh's spellbook](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Medivh "Book of Medivh") to close the Dark Portal from the other side, thereby shielding Azeroth from the final cataclysm of Draenor's destruction. Khadgar ushered the survivors into one of the rifts and returned back to the [remnants of Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland").

Khadgar is immortalized in a massive stone statue in the Valley of Heroes in [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind "Stormwind"), alongside the other leaders of the Alliance Expedition.

Khadgar in [Shattrath City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City "Shattrath City")

In _World of Warcraft_, Khadgar is present in the [Terrace of Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terrace_of_Light "Terrace of Light") of [Shattrath City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City "Shattrath City"). He is affiliated with the [Sons of Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sons_of_Lothar "Sons of Lothar") and brought the [Sha'tar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sha%27tar "Sha'tar") [naaru](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naaru "Naaru") led by A'dal to Outland because he believes that only their power can drive the Legion from this universe. Because of Outland's nature, it is a strategic location in the Nether, and is the perfect staging ground for Legion invasions or a resistance. He hoped to unite both Alliance and Horde against their [true enemies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion").

Khadgar had traveled around Draenor visiting places like [Auchindoun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Auchindoun "Auchindoun") and Tempest Keep.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Mages of the [Violet Eye](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Eye "Violet Eye") asked him for help with the reopening of Karazhan. Four months before the death of the Betrayer, the Sha'tar sent him to [Netherstorm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Netherstorm "Netherstorm") to investigate some strange appearances. So he was not present when [Maiev Shadowsong](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maiev_Shadowsong "Maiev Shadowsong") visited the city but the warden learned about him from [Alexius](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alexius "Alexius"), a [Broken](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken "Broken") innkeeper.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Khadgar, probably an advisor to the naaru called [A'dal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A%27dal "A'dal"), can be found in the central dome of the [Terrace of Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terrace_of_Light "Terrace of Light") of [Shattrath City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City "Shattrath City"), located in the western borders of [Terokkar Forest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terokkar_Forest "Terokkar Forest"). He appears as an NPC representing the need of the [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance") and the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") to work together to defeat the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") (much like the [Argent Dawn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argent_Dawn "Argent Dawn") in Azeroth, which encourages the rival factions to ally against the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge")).

Khadgar likely also met [Vindicator Maraad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicator_Maraad "Vindicator Maraad"), a [draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei") [paladin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin "Paladin"), during this time, and was probably surprised to be informed that Garona was not only half draenei, but was also Maraad's niece. Maraad's explanations of Garona's background gave Khadgar a complete picture of Garona, and a better understanding of her, realizing a parallel between her and Medivh. His experiences, in turn, furthered along with Maraad's search for his niece and knowledge of what happened to her after she left Draenor through the Dark Portal and up until the end of the Second War. The two men apparently also became good friends as the result of meeting each other.

Khadgar explains to the varied [races](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Race "Race") of [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth") that although they may have withstood the Burning Legion twice, the Burning Legion is still marching across the universe continuing their [Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Crusade "Burning Crusade"), an ongoing war to snuff out life in the universe, burning planets and crushing everyone in their path and that [adventurers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") must join the fight.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

### The son of Medivh

[![Comics title.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/98/Comics_title.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/57?cb=20180928143648)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Comics "Comics") **This section concerns content related to the _Warcraft_ [manga](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manga "Manga") or [comics](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Comics "Comics").**

Khadgar in the Comic

[Maraad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maraad "Maraad") would leave for Azeroth with the re-opening of the Dark Portal to continue his search for Garona. He eventually returned briefly with Garona's son, [Med'an](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Med%27an "Med'an"), whom Khadgar could see a resemblance with Maraad, and immediately saw that the youth was likely the son of his old master, [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"). Having just recently learned the truth, and feeling ashamed of his heritage, Med'an confirmed this. However, Khadgar explained that he had eventually realized that Medivh and Garona had been doomed even before birth; victims of [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") and [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan "Gul'dan") respectively. Even so, he says that although he personally had not even suspected Med'an's existence, for Med'an to have been born they must have fought against their fate and through him the demonic forces may yet be undone. Now knowing that his parents were not ultimately responsible for the evil they had wrought, Med'an thanks Khadgar for answering the questions he held in his mind. He refused to join the [New Council of Tirisfal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/New_Council_of_Tirisfal "New Council of Tirisfal") but sent the blood elf [Dalynnia Wrathscar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalynnia_Wrathscar "Dalynnia Wrathscar") instead.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

### Tides of War

Khadgar is revealed to be a member of the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six") and was present during the two meetings between the Council of Six and [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"), who was requesting for help in defending [Theramore Isle](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Theramore_Isle "Theramore Isle") from the Horde and later on for attacking [Orgrimmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrimmar "Orgrimmar").

Though not specified, Khadgar is "the most likely suspect" to have asked [A'dal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A%27dal "A'dal") to sent help to Theramore.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

Khadgar was glad that she had survived Theramore's destruction. As the Council went to discuss Jaina's proposition of destroying Orgrimmar in retaliation for [Rhonin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rhonin "Rhonin")'s death, it was Khadgar who told Jaina the Six's final verdict - Dalaran would not be helping her in attacking Orgrimmar. Their reasoning being that many innocents who had nothing to do with Theramore's destruction would be caught in the crossfire of Jaina's vengeful retribution and Khadgar appealed to Orgrimmar's orphanage as an example of this. Jaina retorted that the children there will be raised to hate the Alliance anyways.

In the end, it was he who suggested that Jaina Proudmoore be elected as the Kirin Tor's new leader as a replacement for the recently deceased [Rhonin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rhonin "Rhonin"); based on scrolls of prophecy that had been written by [Krasus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krasus "Krasus") himself that indicated that Jaina was destined for the position.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

### The Iron Tide

Khadgar as a raven in the [Blasted Lands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blasted_Lands "Blasted Lands")

When the Portal turned red, [Iron Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Horde "Iron Horde") marched into the [Blasted Lands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blasted_Lands "Blasted Lands") and laid waste to [Nethergarde Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nethergarde_Keep "Nethergarde Keep"). Unrivaled in his wisdom and experience, Khadgar was summoned to help repel the invasion.<sup id="cite_ref-Archmage_Khadgar_6-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-Archmage_Khadgar-6">[6]</a></sup> Now freshly shaven,<sup id="cite_ref-shaved_33-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-shaved-33">[33]</a></sup> he is firstly seen at the site of the goblin [Scout Pazaztick](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_Pazaztick "Scout Pazaztick") and the gnome [Scout Pazerp](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scout_Pazerp "Scout Pazerp") examining the Portal. He then transformed into a raven and went to inform Warchief [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") and King [Varian Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varian_Wrynn "Varian Wrynn").<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

### Warlords of Draenor

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/b/b1/KhadgarMaraadThrall.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140923092551)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/b/b1/KhadgarMaraadThrall.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140923092551)

Khadgar with [Maraad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maraad "Maraad") and [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") during the [Iron Horde Incursion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Horde_Incursion "Iron Horde Incursion").

On Draenor, Khadgar shows the ability to transform into a [raven](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Raven "Raven"), which he learned from his mentor [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh").<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> He also is seen wielding [Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atiesh,_Greatstaff_of_the_Guardian "Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian").<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

He led the combined forces of the Horde and Alliance alongside Thrall, [Lady Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin") and Maraad to the crater of the Dark Portal and began the mission to shut down the portal on the Draenor side. In Tanaan he directed the adventurers in deactivating the portal. After it was done, he and his group retreated to the eastern jungle. Commanding the group, they created distraction, only to be stopped by an eye of Kilrogg. Therefore he sent the adventurer and [Ariok](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ariok "Ariok") to distract the eye, while the rest escapes. When [Kilrogg](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kilrogg_Deadeye_(alternate_universe) "Kilrogg Deadeye (alternate universe)") showed up, Ariok sacrificed himself, leaving Khadgar having no choice than to destroy the bridge between them. Near the end of the battle in [Kargathar Proving Grounds](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kargathar_Proving_Grounds "Kargathar Proving Grounds"), he froze the enemy combatants and left for [Umbral Halls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Umbral_Halls "Umbral Halls"). While there he collapsed the entrance and sent [Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Liadrin "Liadrin") and [Olin Umberhide](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Umberhide "Olin Umberhide") / [Exarch Maladaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Exarch_Maladaar_(alternate_universe) "Exarch Maladaar (alternate universe)") and [Qiana Moonshadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Qiana_Moonshadow "Qiana Moonshadow") to scout the cave. After it was done, they faced off [Ner'zhul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ner%27zhul_(alternate_universe) "Ner'zhul (alternate universe)") who tried to collapse the cave. Khadgar teleported the group before the shaman could finish it. In [Blackrock Quarry](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackrock_Quarry "Blackrock Quarry") he assigned his bodyguard, [Cordana Felsong](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cordana_Felsong "Cordana Felsong"), to the adventurer while he used his magic on a dam that eventually crashed and flooded the blackrock orcs. While aiming the Worldbreaker, he and the others fought off the Iron Horde. When the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal_(alternate_universe) "Dark Portal (alternate universe)") collapsed, he left Tanaan on the Iron Horde's ships.

Right after the landfall, he opened portals for [Gazlowe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gazlowe "Gazlowe") and [Baros Alexston](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baros_Alexston "Baros Alexston") to come in and build a [Garrison](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrison "Garrison") for the Horde and Alliance, respectively. In [Frostfire Ridge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frostfire_Ridge "Frostfire Ridge"), Khadgar expressed gratitude that at least some members of the Horde have agreed to work alongside him and the Alliance against the Iron Horde. He stayed in [Starfall Outpost](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Starfall_Outpost "Starfall Outpost") in Shadowmoon planning to stop Gul'dan. Once he located Gul'dan in [Gul'var](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27var "Gul'var") through All-Seeing Eye, that the commander and Cordana had caught, he learned the warlock's plans. Projecting himself to the village, the archmage instructed to catch the leader of the [Shadow Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Council_(alternate_universe) "Shadow Council (alternate universe)"). [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)") escapes before he can be captured. However, he sends the alternate timeline version of Khadgar's old friend [Garona](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garona_Halforcen_(alternate_universe) "Garona Halforcen (alternate universe)") after Khadgar, who nearly succeeds in assassinating him but is stopped and fought off by Cordana. He also travels to Frostfire Ridge, where he asked the Horde commander to help him with the Frostwolf orcs of [Throm'var](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Throm%27var "Throm'var") and continues with his original goal - the Shadow Council (the exact result of catching Gul'dan happens here too).

He is based in [Zangarra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zangarra "Zangarra") in [Talador](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talador "Talador") and welcomes both Alliance and Horde there, though not without trouble from arcane guardians. [Jaina](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina "Jaina") has ordered all outsiders to Dalaran - especially the Horde - are not allowed on Kirin Tor grounds. Despite this, Khadgar says that as he is a member of the Council his friends - regardless of faction - are allowed in, and if Jaina has a problem with it she can take it up with him.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> He introduced the commanders to his friends - [Magister Krelas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magister_Krelas "Magister Krelas") and [Magister Serena](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magister_Serena "Magister Serena") who are to help the faction's Arcane Tower.

Khadgar participates in the [Battle for Shattrath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_Shattrath "Battle for Shattrath") to free the city from the control of the Iron Horde troops led by [Orgrim Doomhammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrim_Doomhammer_(alternate_universe) "Orgrim Doomhammer (alternate universe)") and [Blackhand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackhand_(alternate_universe) "Blackhand (alternate universe)"). His force cleaned up the harbor and Iron Horde's ships. When the heroes attacked Blackhand on his flagship, an explosion happened. Khadgar believed that no one survived but after seeing a flash of the Light, he teleported [Yrel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yrel "Yrel"), [Durotan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Durotan_(alternate_universe) "Durotan (alternate universe)"), commanders and the deceased heroes back to the harbor and ordered to fire the remaining ships. He also asked [Archmage Elandra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Elandra "Archmage Elandra") to assist the [Auchenai](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Auchenai_(alternate_universe) "Auchenai (alternate universe)") in the fight against the Legion; and [Archmage Modera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Modera "Archmage Modera") to spy in [Socrethar's Rise](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Socrethar%27s_Rise "Socrethar's Rise").

He is also seen in [Riverside Post](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Riverside_Post "Riverside Post") and [Yrel's Watch](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yrel%27s_Watch "Yrel's Watch") conversing with Durotan and Yrel, respectively. Ultimately, he and many other are seen near the [Stones of Prophecy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stones_of_Prophecy "Stones of Prophecy") after the death of [Garrosh Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh_Hellscream "Garrosh Hellscream"). He also sent his [elemental servant](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Servant "Khadgar's Servant") to Garrisons in order to inform the commanders about Draenor's threats, such as [Socrethar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Socrethar_(alternate_universe) "Socrethar (alternate universe)").

#### Legendary Journey

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/0f/Archmage_Khadgar_Tower.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150605141047)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/0f/Archmage_Khadgar_Tower.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150605141047)

Khadgar in his [tower](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Tower "Khadgar's Tower")

Later, he works with adventurers to battle Gul'dan and the Shadow Council, who he sees as a far greater threat than the Iron Horde is. At this point, Khadgar offers quests to obtain a ring from [Skyreach](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skyreach "Skyreach"), which he imbues with power over the course of the questline. During the beginning adventures, he instructed the adventurer to obtain various items from across Draenor. After Maladaar sent him an urgent message, he had the commanders infiltrate [Auchindoun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Auchindoun_(alternate_universe) "Auchindoun (alternate universe)") where they seemingly killed Teron'gor and acquired his blood, which was then used in a failed attempt to locate Gul'dan. Later the commanders and Khadgar met up with [Chromie](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chromie "Chromie") in [Nagrand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nagrand_(alternate_universe) "Nagrand (alternate universe)"). They were searching for [Kairozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kairozdormu "Kairozdormu"), only to find his corpse in the [Time-Lost Glade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Time-Lost_Glade "Time-Lost Glade") where they battled with his spirit, defeating it in the process.

Khadgar then wants the adventurer to venture through [Highmaul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Highmaul "Highmaul") and retrieve ogre artifacts from there in order to find out the secrets of the [sorcerer king](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Imperator_Mar%27gok_(alternate_universe) "Imperator Mar'gok (alternate universe)"). When the adventurer returns from Highmaul, Khadgar starts his spell to find Gul'dan once again, this time managing to converse with Gul'dan. Gul'dan informs Khadgar that he had been inquiring about him and discovered that they have a history - and that the scrying works both ways. Garona tries again to kill Khadgar, and this time, she successfully poisons him only for his life to be saved by Cordana and the recently arrived [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"). Jaina brings up that the Horde have no involvement in the Council of Six's business. She does not approve of this, but Khadgar remains steadfast and says it is not the first time he has disagreed with the Council of Six. Garona is subsequently captured as Khadgar begins searching for a way to break Gul'dan's mind control spell on her.

His next goal is thus the [Blackrock Foundry](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackrock_Foundry "Blackrock Foundry") and its elemental knowledge and artifacts, ultimately leading to the death of Warlord [Blackhand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackhand_(alternate_universe) "Blackhand (alternate universe)"). With the artifacts obtained, Khadgar attempted to use a spell to break Gul'dan's hold on Garona. He begins channeling the spell, which makes Garona reel in agony; Khadgar interrogates Garona as to her master's location, quickly growing agitated as he intensifies the spell. Cordana implores Khadgar to stop, seeing this as torture. Khadgar realizes what he is doing and relents, opting to find another way. Khadgar instructs the adventurer to continue their efforts against the Iron Horde while he researches alternative methods.

A short time later, Khadgar sends the adventurer to obtain an  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/de/Inv_icon_shadowcouncilorb_purple.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20180818180918)[\[Orb of Dominion\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orb_of_Dominion), an artifact used by the Shadow Council to brainwash their spies, in order to break Gul'dan's hold over Garona's mind. The adventurer returns with the Orb, and Khadgar uses it to expose Garona's Demon Within, a shadowy representation of Gul'dan's will. When the creature is slain, Garona thanks Khadgar and the adventurer for her freedom, and vows to fight alongside them.

Garona later leads Khadgar and the adventurer to [Bladefury's Command](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bladefury%27s_Command "Bladefury's Command"), an Iron Horde outpost in [Talador](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talador "Talador"), where Gul'dan is planning to meet with [Grommash Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grommash_Hellscream_(alternate_universe) "Grommash Hellscream (alternate universe)"). Garona and the adventurer sneak inside and witness Gul'dan, once again, offering demonic blood to Grommash, saying that Hellscream's men have died for nothing - including his son, Garrosh. Grommash furiously declines and attempts to strike Gul'dan down, but is restrained by the warlock's demonic magic. Gul'dan then offers his blood to the rest of the orcs present; [Kilrogg](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kilrogg_Deadeye_(alternate_universe) "Kilrogg Deadeye (alternate universe)") steps forward and drinks the blood, becoming a vicious fel orc. Garona and the adventurer inform Khadgar of these events, and Khadgar notes that [history](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_War "First War") is poised to repeat itself; he instructs the adventurer to marshal their garrison for an assault on Tanaan Jungle, while he researches ways to counter Gul'dan's magic, promising to be in contact soon.

#### Fury of Hellfire

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/95/KhadgarYrel.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150807134804)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/95/KhadgarYrel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150807134804)

Khadgar and [Yrel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yrel "Yrel") after [Archimonde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archimonde "Archimonde") is defeated.

Some time later, Khadgar arrived to Frostwall / Lunarfall to begin the preparations for the next attack. Shortly after the commander's shipyard is built, it's time to get the experience of navy combat. Khadgar will tell the commander to find a [map](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenic_Sea_Chart "Draenic Sea Chart") and obtain [books](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tome_of_Chaos "Tome of Chaos") from inside [Hellfire Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hellfire_Citadel_(alternate_universe) "Hellfire Citadel (alternate universe)"). When they arrive back to him with everything he needed, Khadgar tells the commander to go his tower and tell Cordana to destroy the books you've collected. Unfortunately, it turns that Cordana had kept the [orb](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orb_of_Dominion "Orb of Dominion"), which leads to a fight with the Warden before she stuns them and opens up a demonic portal in order to retreat. Khadgar is visibly stricken with grief at this betrayal, but shoulders on. After the commander has gone to [Karabor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Be_With_You "Light Be With You")/[Throne of the Elements](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor%27s_Blessing "Draenor's Blessing") to accept the final blessings of their ring, Khadgar the commander into the heart of Hellfire Citadel itself to thwart Gul'dan.

Khadgar arrives at the gates shortly after the [downfall of an experiment](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Reaver "Iron Reaver") and begins to channel to make portals all over the citadel. He is then seen after the defeat of [Gorefiend](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gorefiend "Gorefiend"), horrified by the sight, he teleports the adventurers further into the Citadel. After adventurers defeat [Mannoroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mannoroth_(tactics) "Mannoroth (tactics)"), it's time to end Gul'dan's reign of terror for he has no place left to run, and he wants his [skull for reasons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_of_Gul%27dan "Skull of Gul'dan")...

Khadgar accompanies Yrel and Grommash as they fight Archimonde alongside with the [heroes of Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer"). After the battle, he goes up to the portal and looks down at the staff of Gul'dan and sees it turn into disappear into fel flames. He then tells Yrel that Gul'dan and the devils that command him are not so easily banished. For he fears that [this is only beginning](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "World of Warcraft: Legion").

Future

During the fight against [Kilrogg Deadeye](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kilrogg_Deadeye "Kilrogg Deadeye"), the [adventurer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") is shown a possible vision of their death, where Khadgar and the adventurer fight a losing battle in [Stormwind Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_Keep "Stormwind Keep")/[the Royal Quarter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Royal_Quarter "The Royal Quarter") (depending on the adventurer's faction) against the demons of the Burning Legion. The vision ends when Khadgar dies and sends out a blast of arcane energy, killing everything in the throne room.

### The third invasion

_Though he was unable to stop [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)") from opening the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras"), allowing the [Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") to flood into [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth") once more, Khadgar is determined to find the means to reseal the portal and foil the Legion's invasion. He knows that the combined forces of the greatest champions of Azeroth are necessary to succeed, even as dissenting voices speak against a coalition and risk ultimate destruction by the demons._<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

#### The Tomb of Sargeras

Seeking to locate Gul'dan, Khadgar would eventually track his magical signature to the [Broken Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Isles "Broken Isles"). Upon arriving he meet up with [Maiev Shadowsong](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maiev_Shadowsong "Maiev Shadowsong") seeking her help in finding Gul'dan, though the warden would refuse and hold Khadgar responsible for Cordana's betrayal. Disappointed Khadgar would depart in order to continue his search for Gul'dan. However both Khadgar and Maiev were unaware that Gul'dan had observed their meeting, before leaving at Kil'jaeden's command. The warlock would reach reached the [island](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shore "Broken Shore") that his other self had raised from the ocean depths many years prior. With ease, he dismantled the [arcane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane "Arcane") locks and barriers blocking the entrance into the Tomb of Sargeras before blasting the door open and swiftly plunging into the darkness.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/03/Khadgar_vs_Gul%27dan.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160820190851)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/03/Khadgar_vs_Gul%27dan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160820190851)

Khadgar and Gul'dan.

Shortly thereafter, Khadgar entered the tomb as well after hearing the massive blast caused by the door's destruction. After evading several of the deadly magical traps laid by Gul'dan, the mage confronted the warlock in a towering chamber, and a furious battle erupted. Colossal waves of arcane and fel crashed together, threatening to ignite the air around the two combatants. Kil'jaeden's voice angrily told Gul'dan that neither of the two could die this day and that he had to withdraw. Realizing that if he did not obey, he would get cut off from the Legion immediately, the warlock shrouded himself in fel, causing Khadgar's arcane magic to unleash a blinding explosion. When he had opened his eyes again, Gul'dan was gone. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensued, with Khadgar taunting Gul'dan in attempt to bring him out of hiding while launching blasts of fire at random into the darkness.

After a lucky shot almost reduced him to cinders, Gul'dan convinced Kil'jaeden to tell him about the power locked in the tomb and how to unleash it. Then, using this knowledge, he began deactivating the five arcane seals that had been created in the tomb by the [Highborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Highborne "Highborne") of Suramar during the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients") using the five [Pillars of Creation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation "Pillars of Creation"). Khadgar noticed this attempt and began sending out [arcane elementals](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_elemental "Arcane elemental") to find the warlock while also starting to ask if the orc had ever learned of the fate of his main universe counterpart. Gul'dan ignored him, continuing to break the seals until he reached the fifth and final one, which had begun growing more powerful with each passing moment, arcane energy surging into it — a mechanism created hundreds of years ago by [a female Guardian of Tirisfal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegwynn "Aegwynn"). Khadgar sensed this and created a massive arcane wedge and began slamming it into the floor of the chamber. Gul'dan threw his concealing illusion aside, and the battle between the mage and the warlock erupted once again. Realizing that he could not kill Khadgar _and_ break the last seal at the same time, Gul'dan attempted to convince Kil'jaeden to infuse him with the tomb's power, while Khadgar finished his story and revealed the fate of the original timeline's Gul'dan: having been torn apart by the demons he had once served. Gul'dan suddenly realized that he was guaranteed to outlive his usefulness in the Legion's eyes, but in that moment, Kil'jaeden conceded and allowed the energies of the tomb to surge into the orc.

Gul'dan immediately ceased his attack upon Khadgar, instead crushing the final seal in a fist of fel fire. The energies necessary to tear open a rift between Azeroth and the Nether began surging towards the portal buried below Thal'dranath, but Gul'dan seized them for himself. After a moment of drowning in pain beneath an endless ocean of power, he regained his control and, by lifting only a finger, caused the chamber to erupt with overwhelming fury. Khadgar managed to seal himself in ice once more, but Gul'dan simply hurled the ice block through a doorway before collapsing tons of rock on top of it, blocking the entrance.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/62/Legion_Trailer_-_Khadgar.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220426132008)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/62/Legion_Trailer_-_Khadgar.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220426132008)

Khadgar warns [Varian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varian_Wrynn "Varian Wrynn") and [Anduin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Wrynn "Anduin Wrynn") of the [Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion")'s return.

Khadgar would free himself from the ice and subsequently be joined by Maiev Shadowsong. Working together the pair would breach the chamber and head towards Gul'dan, who with no effort would brush their attacks away again and again, yet they would keep coming at him. Reconging the need for assistance Gul'dan would let his power slip away from him and down towards the portal, at last allowing the Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth to commence. As Khadgar and Maiev dropped to the floor, Kil'jaeden commended Gul'dan for his choice, and now Gul'dan had something he had never had from the Legion before: their trust.

As demons began pouring into the out of the portal Khadgar and Maiev ran for their lives, with the Warden heading north to fortify the [Vault of the Wardens](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_of_the_Wardens "Vault of the Wardens") and Khadgar transforming into a raven to fly east. As the archmage glanced back towards the ever-darkening sky above the tomb, he saw Gul'dan levitating in the middle of the inferno, laughing and pointing towards the fleeing archmage to order several demons to pursue him.<sup id="cite_ref-Tomb_of_Sargeras_39-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-Tomb_of_Sargeras-39">[39]</a></sup> Khadger would evade them however and fly to [Stormwind Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_Keep "Stormwind Keep") and personally informed [King Varian Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varian_Wrynn "Varian Wrynn") and [Prince Anduin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Wrynn "Anduin Wrynn") about the arrival of the Legion.

#### Harbingers

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e5/Harbingers_Khadgar_1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160728174133)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e5/Harbingers_Khadgar_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160728174133)

Khadgar and the "spirit" of Medivh.

Some time after the Legion's initial return to Azeroth, Khadgar flew to [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan") on a [gryphon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gryphon "Gryphon") in search of knowledge to aid against the demons. While he was searching the libraries of the tower, an image of his old mentor [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh") appeared before him, asking why he had come. When Khadgar said that he was seeking knowledge, Medivh replied that what he needed was not knowledge, but a weapon — that it was time that Azeroth had a [Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal") once again. Khadgar angrily replied that it was decided after Medivh's death that none could resist the temptation of such power and that a Guardian was not what Azeroth needed, to which Medivh asked "If not a Guardian, if not you, then who can stop the approaching storm?" The former Guardian showed his former student a vision of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") falling from the sky in flames, saying that if he did not accept his fate, all that Khadgar had accomplished and sacrificed would be for nothing.

Khadgar objected by saying that even if he said yes, there were none remaining capable of bestowing the powers of a Guardian upon him. Medivh simply replied, "I remain". He claimed that he had known this day would come, and that before his death he had imbued a tome with an echo of his essence, and that opening it would make its energies be absorbed into Khadgar. While Khadgar was still hesitant, Medivh urged him to accept his desires and showed him a vision of the new Guardian annihilating an endless army of demons by channeling their powers through Atiesh. Khadgar at last admitted that he had long desired the position and yearned for the Legion to cringe before the fury he would unleash... which was why he could never accept Medivh's offer. Medivh's eyes flashed [fel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fel "Fel") green as his mouth twisted into a demonic maw, just as Khadgar unleashed an explosion which destroyed the tome and revealed that Medivh's echo was in fact a monstrously gargantuan [nathrezim](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathrezim "Nathrezim"). The demon growled that Khadgar's will was strong and that he would have served the Legion well, to which the mage replied that he would never be the Legion's pawn, and that Karazhan would never be their den. Through Atiesh, he then channeled a beam of [arcane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane "Arcane") energy that destroyed the demon and blew a hole through a window in the tower.

As Khadgar left the tower and mounted his gryphon once more, he came to the realization that no single person, not even a Guardian, could hope to stand against the Legion alone, and that the mortals of Azeroth must once again band together, united, _for Azeroth_.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

#### Legion

[![Legion](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Legion-Logo-Small.png/revision/latest?cb=20150808040028)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "Legion") **This section concerns content related to _[Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "World of Warcraft: Legion")_.**

After Dalaran temporarily moved above Karazhan, he asks the other members of the Council of Six to allow the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") back into the Kirin Tor, knowing that the conclave needs the addition of Horde mages to fight at full strength against the Legion. Jaina refuses as she still holds immense blame on them for destroying Theramore and seemingly abandoning the Alliance at the [Battle for the Broken Shore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_for_the_Broken_Shore "Battle for the Broken Shore"). The council holds a vote that ends 4-2 in the favor of the Horde rejoining. Jaina teleports out in anger, leaving Dalaran and the Kirin Tor in the hands of Khadgar. As the council decides their next move, [Brann Bronzebeard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brann_Bronzebeard "Brann Bronzebeard") shows up explaining that his brother Magni has awoken from his imprisonment and has gone to Ulduar. Khadgar and an adventurer go off to Ulduar and, after fighting off forces from both [Yogg-Saron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yogg-Saron "Yogg-Saron") and the Legion, learn Magni has been talking with Azeroth herself, revealing that the planet is a Titan. He then goes on to explain that the only way to end the legion invasion is with the [Pillars of Creation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation "Pillars of Creation"). Khadgar recognizes the name and believes he saw them in one of Medivh's books in Karazhan. He and the adventurer teleport to the tower to find the book, but discover that defenses that Khadgar had installed on a previous trip have been activated. After fending off the Legion and the tower's defenses, they find the book and take it back to Dalaran, where they summon the spirit of [Alodi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alodi "Alodi"), the first guardian and author of the book, to tell them where the pillars are. Alodi explains they are in the [Broken Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Isles "Broken Isles") and, after fending off the Legion and closing up several small arcane anomalies in the city, Khadgar and the mages of Dalaran teleport the city to the Isles.

Khadgar later traveled to the Vault of the Wardens to ask the recently freed Illidari to join the fight against the Legion. He teleported them to Stormwind City and Orgrimmar.

A [Highmountain tauren](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Highmountain_tauren "Highmountain tauren") named [Warbrave Oro](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warbrave_Oro "Warbrave Oro") visiting Dalaran at Krasus' Landing awaiting the [class champion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer"). Khadgar states that the people in the mountain could be prove a powerful ally in the war against the Legion.

News from [Val'sharah](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Val%27sharah "Val'sharah") made Khadgar rarely say that there's good news: [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malfurion_Stormrage "Malfurion Stormrage") managed to return to his home of druidism and took care of things and is off on ahead start.

Khadgar accompanies the class champion to Azsuna. He believes he uncovered information concerning an ancient relic, which might be the key to stopping the Legion. The naga also play a part in this as [Queen Azshara](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Azshara "Queen Azshara") herself wants the [Pillar of Creation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pillar_of_Creation "Pillar of Creation") in the area which came to Khadgar's surprise. The [Illidari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidari "Illidari") are the first thing to deal with before engaging of find the relic. After rescuing a [blue dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragon "Blue dragon") named [Stellagosa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stellagosa "Stellagosa"), she told him that her grandfather [Senegos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Senegos "Senegos"), the eldest of the [blue dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragonflight "Blue dragonflight"), knows where the Pillar of Creation is. As both Khadgar and the champion arrive at [Azurewing Repose](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azurewing_Repose "Azurewing Repose"), the blue dragon was in a weakened state that Khadgar was able to stabilize Senegos with his magic. After collecting [Crackling Leyworm Cores](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Crackling_Leyworm_Core "Crackling Leyworm Core") and throwing them into Senegos's pool, Khadgar asks him about the Pillar of Creation. Senegos told him about the relic: the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/47/Inv_misc_enchantedpearl.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20100930220042)[\[Tidestone of Golganneth\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tidestone_of_Golganneth) and was shattered ages ago. Khadgar awed of how it happened and the elder dragon didn't know, but he knows where the pieces lie. Khadgar eventually defended [Azurewing Repose](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azurewing_Repose "Azurewing Repose") from the [Nightfallen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightfallen "Nightfallen") alongside with their [Withered](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Withered "Withered").

The Archmage has made a discovery and tells the class champion to report to the [Violet Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Citadel "Violet Citadel"). The [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six"), the champion, and Khadgar witnesses a message from a [Arcane Anomaly](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane_Anomaly "Arcane Anomaly") of a [nightborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne "Nightborne") named [First Arcanist Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_Arcanist_Thalyssra "First Arcanist Thalyssra"), telling them that her people made a [dire pact](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"). Khadgar opens up a portal to [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar") and informs the champion to be careful since the land has been wild for ten thousand years.

A [sentry](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sentry_Pierce "Sentry Pierce") in [Trueshot Lodge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Trueshot_Lodge "Trueshot Lodge") spots emergency signal flares up on a hill. Both [Emmarel Shadewarden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Emmarel_Shadewarden "Emmarel Shadewarden") and the [hunter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") go to investigate and finds out Khadgar sent those flares. He states that some of his best archmages have gone missing and have been getting killed off. The hunter follows him and spots [felstalkers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felstalker "Felstalker") consuming magics from the mages. Led by [Hakkar the Houndmaster](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hakkar_the_Houndmaster "Hakkar the Houndmaster"), they were unsuccessful to stop the threat in the area. Eventually, the three elite rangers [Halduron Brightwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Halduron_Brightwing "Halduron Brightwing"), [Shandris Feathermoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shandris_Feathermoon "Shandris Feathermoon"), and [Vereesa Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vereesa_Windrunner "Vereesa Windrunner") joined the cause and plotted their next move. Vereesa's plan was to lure a trap within the [Violet Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Hold "Violet Hold"), which to that decree Khadgar and the others agreed. Khadgar channeled his essence in a arcane vessel to draw out the Houndmaster which will make him valuable; unable to assist. Hakkar was defeated by the hunters and the archmage was relieved that the threat was stopped.

Regarding [Meryl's](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Meryl_Felstorm "Meryl Felstorm") condition, [Ravandwyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ravandwyr "Ravandwyr") called the archmage to help investigate on how to cure the illness. To make matters worse, [Archmage Vargoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Vargoth "Archmage Vargoth") has been absent from the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six") during this time that made him concern of his comrade. The [mage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") and [Archmage Kalec](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Kalec "Archmage Kalec") went to investigate on him alongside in search for the cure. Eventually, it turned out the dreadlord [Kathra'natir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kathra%27natir "Kathra'natir") was playing with an image of Meryl from distances away. A gem called the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/de/Inv_icon_shadowcouncilorb_purple.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20180818180918)[\[Nightborne Soulstone\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne_Soulstone) that both the mage and [Millhouse Manastorm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Millhouse_Manastorm "Millhouse Manastorm") recovered in [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar") could be the only way to contain the dreadlord. Succeed and Meryl came back to his senses, they kept Kathra'natir within the stone. Khadgar told Meryl that with the council and the newest archmage leading the class order, they will be able to defeat the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"). Millhouse just wanted to use the soulstone for his own needs. Khadgar remarks that so long as the Soulstone serves as Kathra'natir's prison it is best left untouched, and he was sure that there are plenty of other powerful artifacts out there for the gnome to find.

When [Deucus Valdera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deucus_Valdera "Deucus Valdera") accidentally summoned the projection of [Svena the Infused](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Svena_the_Infused "Svena the Infused"), she threatened to destroy Dalaran. Khadgar sensed her presence and quickly arrived at the [Agronomical Apothecary](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Agronomical_Apothecary "Agronomical Apothecary"), blasting the projection away. After assuring that everyone was alright, he warned Deucus to have more care when handling ancient relics, and left.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

Khadgar finally sees his [old friend](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") after many years.

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/0a/TuralyonBringerLight.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160831134142)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/0a/TuralyonBringerLight.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160831134142)

A message from Turalyon appears in front of Khadgar.

The archmage says that the [Order of the Silver Hand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Silver_Hand "Order of the Silver Hand") have reported that an extraordinarily luminescent object has emerged from the [Felstorm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felstorm "Felstorm") and is currently falling towards the coast of [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar"). What he found most curious about this occurrence is that the object was reported as having "cut a swath" through the Felstorm itself. The champion goes to the shores of Suramar and finds the object in the hands of a sea giant named [Yorg Murkmouth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yorg_Murkmouth "Yorg Murkmouth") within a underwater cave. Upon returning to the [Hall of the Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hall_of_the_Guardian "Hall of the Guardian"), Khadgar examines the object and actives itself to tell us a message from the beyond. It was from his dear old friend [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") and he says that the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/0d/Inv_jewelcrafting_taladitecrystal.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20141002092827)[\[Mysterious Lightbound Object\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterious_Lightbound_Object) must be brought to the [Prophet](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Velen "Velen"), for he knows what it is. Khadgar then makes a portal to the [Exodar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Exodar "Exodar") to send the adventurer to deliver what transpired. Returning from Velen of the information given to us as well as [mourning a conflict what transpired in the city](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_General_Rakeesh "High General Rakeesh"), the one place on Azeroth that he would trust with the safekeeping of the object: the class champion's order hall. Placing  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/0/0d/Inv_jewelcrafting_taladitecrystal.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20141002092827)[\[Light's Heart\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light%27s_Heart) in the order hall, Khadgar sends a crystal ball of his image to the champion in this base of operations that he may have found a "key" of unlocking it. Khadgar believes that [Elune](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elune "Elune") may have created the naaru prime [Xe'ra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xe%27ra "Xe'ra") with her [tears](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tears_of_Elune "Tears of Elune"), and could be used to unlock the secrets within.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> After obtaining the tears, Khadgar readied it for transport to the [Violet Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Citadel "Violet Citadel") to give to the class champion. Upon using it at the order hall, Xe'ra appears before the class champion and is told everything about her mission of desperation: the [child of Light and Shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage "Illidan Stormrage"). Being unconscious for 3 days according to [Vicktor Ebonfall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vicktor_Ebonfall "Vicktor Ebonfall"), the champion rushed to the Violet Citadel to tell Khadgar what they have learned. For the first time the archmage felt powerless to do anything from beyond what he just heard. Khadgar then wanted to be alone for at his age it's too much to bear.

In the days to come, the champion and Xe'ra would together discover Illidan's history, his purpose and most importantly: work to bring him back into the fold. After gathering [many soul fragments](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Prism_of_the_Illidari_(quest) "Soul Prism of the Illidari (quest)") for [Allari the Souleater](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Allari_the_Souleater "Allari the Souleater"), it was later discovered that the soul of Illidan was taken to [Helheim](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Helheim "Helheim") by [Helya](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Helya "Helya") after she struck a bargain with [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)"). The champion returns with the demon hunter's soul within the [Soul Prism](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Prism_of_the_Illidari "Soul Prism of the Illidari") and gives it to Xe'ra. She tells the class champion to deliver the vessel to Khadgar with the following instructions: when Gul'dan attempts to tear the sky asunder and bring the dark titan into our world, call forth the power of this vessel and release Illidan's soul into his body. Khadgar was surprised by their plan but stated he will do his best with the Light's Heart in his possession.

#### Assault of Karazhan

He later returns to Karazhan once the Legion has infiltrated the tower, working with the Kirin Tor and a band of heroes to liberate it from their grasp. Finding that Medivh had bound the tower to the Legion core worlds during his possession by Sargeras, Khadgar sets off to undo the bindings as the heroes fight to rid the tower of Legion influence. By the end of the tower, Khadgar has unbound most but not all of them, finding it impossible to undo the final bindings. This is done, instead, by his teacher, [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"), who re-appears suddenly before the group to aid them. Shocked, Khadgar attempts to question his teacher where he has been, but the fight with the Legion takes precedent. After the band of heroes defeats the Legion in the Netherspace, he asks Medivh to aid them in their fight, only to be declined as the former guardian is "needed elsewhere". Instead, Medivh states that Azeroth has found her Guardian in Khadgar, despite the latter declining the power of the Magna. Told by Medivh he does not need the power of the Tirisfalen, rather, he has all the power he needs due to his courage, will and heart to protect the world, which makes him this world's Guardian; and also he will be a far better guardian than Medivh ever was. Medivh also says that while it may be simpler to shut [a door](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras") than pass through it, sometimes a step into [the unknown](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus") is required to break the bonds of fate. With that, he flies off as a raven into the Nether.

With the tower secured, Khadgar returns to Dalaran with the heroes of Azeroth, pondering on where his mentor has departed to.

#### Suramar

Khadgar and the Kirin Tor travel to Suramar to aid the [Nightfallen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightfallen "Nightfallen") rebellion against [Grand Magistrix Elisande](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magistrix_Elisande "Grand Magistrix Elisande") and serve as peacekeepers between the [night](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf"), [blood](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_elf "Blood elf"), and [high](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_elf "High elf") elves. Khadgar befriends [Oculeth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Oculeth "Oculeth") as the two work together to teleport enemy [Nightborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightborne "Nightborne") forces out of the way. When Elisande uses the power of the [Nightwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell "Nightwell") to freeze time on the united elf army, Khadgar works with an adventurer to free [Lady Liadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Liadrin "Lady Liadrin") and [Tyrande Whisperwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyrande_Whisperwind "Tyrande Whisperwind"), but is unable to free the rest due to how dangerous the time stop is. After the death of Elisande's First Arcanist of the Duskwatch [Andaris Narassin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Andaris_Narassin "Andaris Narassin"), the breach is secured as Oculeth teleports Thalyssra and Khadgar to the champion's position. When they arrive at the entrance to the Nighthold raid, Khadgar believes that if the timelock spell is broken, Gul'dan will surely fall. He clearly states that the Withered will not be able to handle what's coming in there and relies on the hero to gather an [elite group](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Raid "Raid") together and will be right behind them.

Within the Nighthold the [Chronomatic Anomaly](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chronomatic_Anomaly "Chronomatic Anomaly") is taken out as the timelock spell is lifted and Khadgar will tell the remaining forces of what happened because they will be disoriented, and will eventually catch up. After [Spellblade Aluriel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spellblade_Aluriel "Spellblade Aluriel") was slain by the champions, the gates were finally breached as it took some time that they had to clean up out front. Progressing deeper into the city he wondered about that [palace gardener](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_Botanist_Tel%27arn "High Botanist Tel'arn"), and simply Thalyssra comments that he took his job seriously. Krosus returns to the [Twisting Nether](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twisting_Nether "Twisting Nether") as Khadgar proclaims that [Tirion Fordring](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tirion_Fordring "Tirion Fordring") may have not been killed by the doomlord by play a role in this war. He tells the champions a briefing of [Tichondrius](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tichondrius "Tichondrius") and comments that the [demon hunter's spirit](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage "Illidan Stormrage") is pleased that the dreadlord has met another painful end.

Argus visible in the sky above Azsuna.

Khadgar spoke to [Prophet Velen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prophet_Velen "Prophet Velen") and the champions of the order halls at [Krasus' Landing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krasus%27_Landing "Krasus' Landing") about using the Pillars of Creation to close the portal at the Tomb of Sargeras. However, Velen reminded all assembled that Gul'dan was merely a pawn and [Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden "Kil'jaeden") was still out there. Kil'jaeden, watching this all from his ship in orbit above [Argus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus"), sent [Legion ships](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Legion_ship "Legion ship") to assault Dalaran.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

Khadgar led the [Assault on Broken Shore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_on_Broken_Shore "Assault on Broken Shore").<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> By studying the writings of [Aegwynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegwynn "Aegwynn"), he learned that the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/2/2f/Ability_paladin_shieldofthetemplar.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20080826222526)[\[Aegis of Aggramar\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegis_of_Aggramar) could trigger a failsafe in the Tomb of Sargeras if it were to be placed in the [Cathedral of Eternal Night](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Eternal_Night "Cathedral of Eternal Night"). [Illidan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Illidan "Illidan") and [Maiev](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maiev "Maiev") traveled to the cathedral, while Khadgar and Velen descended into the tomb.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> However, near the top of the cathedral, an image of Khadgar appeared before Maiev, Illidan, and the adventurers to tell them that the assault on the lower levels of the tomb was a failure. After Illidan and Maiev led adventurers in defeating the [dreadlord](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dreadlord "Dreadlord") [Mephistroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mephistroth "Mephistroth"), an echo of the former [Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian "Guardian") [Aegwynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegwynn "Aegwynn") appeared and spoke to the champions. She revealed to them that she intends to later aid them in their quest and also what would truly be required to close the Legion's portal; the [Pillars of Creation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation "Pillars of Creation") would have to be used in the depths of the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras"). After hearing this information, Maiev stated that Khadgar would want to hear of this and relayed Aegwynn's information to him.

After defeating [Goroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Goroth "Goroth"), Khadgar and the champions of [Legionfall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Legionfall "Legionfall") regrouped at the [Chamber of the Moon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chamber_of_the_Moon "Chamber of the Moon"), where he and other champions met with the echo of Aegwynn. Aegwynn informed them that the Legion was intending to reanimate [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras")' [Fallen Avatar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fallen_Avatar "Fallen Avatar"). Aegwynn instructed Khadgar on how to use the Pillars of Creation to unbar her protective wards to the Avatar of Sargeras in order to prevent the Legion from claiming the avatar. After battling their way to unbar Aegwynn's wards and placing all of the Pillars of Creation, Khadgar returned to Aegwynn to report their success and to declare to her that they will not fail in thwarting [Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden "Kil'jaeden")'s plan. Although Illidan and Aegwynn warned Khadgar of the great danger and intimidating obstacles they would face, Khadgar was certain that if they stood together, Azeroth can yet be saved.

While adventurers battled the [Fallen Avatar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fallen_Avatar "Fallen Avatar"), Illidan, Khadgar, and Velen faced Kil'jaeden. When Kil'jaeden retreated to his [Legion ship](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Legion_ship "Legion ship"), Khadgar sought to close the portal to his [command ship](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Legion_ship "Legion ship"). However, Velen rushed through the portal to follow Kil'jaeden in pursuit, despite Khadgar's protests. Illidan encouraged Velen's initiative and convinced Khadgar that the Legion's invasions would never end unless they pursue Kil'jaeden and vanquish him once and for all. Upon Kil'jaeden's death, his ship began to crash on Argus. Illidan used the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/32/Inv_7ti_titan_sargeritekeystone.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20160428145829)[\[Sargerite Keystone\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargerite_Keystone) to open a rift between Argus and Azeroth, allowing Khadgar to teleport them safely to [Azsuna](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azsuna "Azsuna"). Upon their return to Azeroth however, it was revealed that Illidan had left the rift from Azeroth to Argus open, and Argus became visible on Azeroth's sky. Khadgar, horrified, asked Illidan what he had done, and Illidan responded that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.

#### Argus

The forces aboard the _Vindicaar_ prepare to assault Argus.

Khadgar traveled to Argus aboard the _[Vindicaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicaar "Vindicaar")_, a new [dimensional ship](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensional_ship "Dimensional ship") crafted by the [draenei](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei "Draenei"). He can be found within the Vindicaar's Matrix Core room alongside [Aethas Sunreaver](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aethas_Sunreaver "Aethas Sunreaver"), where the two discussed how each feels overwhelmed by the powers at play. Khadgar can also be found at [Darkfall Ridge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkfall_Ridge "Darkfall Ridge") where he fights demons seeking to reach the Vindicaar.

In a reunion with [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon") and [Alleria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner"), he informed them that [Danath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Danath_Trollbane "Danath Trollbane") and [Kurdran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kurdran_Wildhammer "Kurdran Wildhammer") were both still alive though he did not get to see them as often as he would like. The three agreed that when the fight was behind them the [Sons of Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sons_of_Lothar "Sons of Lothar") would hold a reunion feast and that, at Alleria's insistence, it would be Khadgar's turn to buy the drinks.

After [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") was imprisoned by the [Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pantheon "Pantheon") at the [Seat of the Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Seat_of_the_Pantheon "Seat of the Pantheon"), Khadgar said that the campaign against the Legion had been long and wavering. After traversing entire worlds and spanning the Twisting Nether itself to finally achieve victory, he was tired. Yet he knew he could not rest, for Magni's visions of doom shook him to his core. Only one titan remained, and Khadgar knew they had to defend it.

#### The Wound

However, Sargeras's final desperate attack on Azeroth, stabbing her in [Silithus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithus "Silithus"), caused her grievous harm. As her blood began to appear on the surface in the form of a powerful magical resource called [Azerite](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azerite "Azerite"), the Alliance and Horde started to fight over it with war threatened on the horizon. Khadgar had hoped that after the Legion's defeat the people of Azeroth would have built a new future together. Not wanting to stay and watch more lives be lost, nor willing to take up arms against either side after all they had been through together, Khadgar instead chose to go to Karazhan and speak to Medivh. He hoped that somewhere in Medivh's ancient texts lay the knowledge needed to heal the world.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Khadgar and Magni came up with the plan of using the [artifact](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Artifact "Artifact") weapons to drain the power from the [Sword of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_of_Sargeras "Sword of Sargeras").<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

### Exploring Azeroth

Khadgar remained in the tower, and [SI:7](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/SI:7 "SI:7") check up on him. The archmage was disappointed about the [war](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War") and refused to participate in it, instead he hoped to aid the wounded world. Following the war, he learned about the armistice between the Alliance and Horde, and hoped that they will see the strength in unity. He wrote a letter to [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw") about the status of artifacts stored in Karazhan and revealed that he was also trying to repair the erratic [Curator](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Curator "The Curator"). With the letter, he sent [Garona's Signet Ring](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garona%27s_Signet_Ring "Garona's Signet Ring") and asked Shaw to return it to Garona. Khadgar had also met with [Revil Kost](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Revil_Kost "Revil Kost") who came to return the [Cloak of Purity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak_of_Purity "Cloak of Purity"). The archmage noted that he was the angriest priest he had ever met.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

### Shadowlands

[![Shadowlands](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/9a/Shadowlands-Icon-Inline.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/48?cb=20210930025728)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Shadowlands "Shadowlands") **This section concerns content related to _[Shadowlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Shadowlands "World of Warcraft: Shadowlands")_.**

Feeling the weight of the world upon him from the burdens he carried and the choices he made, Khadgar decided to visit the [Shadowlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowlands "Shadowlands") before his own end. After arriving in [Oribos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Oribos "Oribos"), he conversed with [Jaina](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina "Jaina") who was able to cheer him up. Having become intrigued by tales of conniving [brokers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broker "Broker"), a city of secrets, and a land of ancient knowledge, Khadgar sent off to explore the Shadowlands.

### Dragonflight

[![Dragonflight](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/61/Dragonflight-Icon-Inline.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/48?cb=20220428173245)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Dragonflight "Dragonflight") **This section concerns content related to _[Dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Dragonflight "World of Warcraft: Dragonflight")_.**

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/86/Khadgar_and_Kalecgos_-_Tempest_Unleashed.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20221227173411)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/86/Khadgar_and_Kalecgos_-_Tempest_Unleashed.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20221227173411)

Khadgar accepts to help [Kalecgos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalecgos "Kalecgos") and to rally the mortals races against the [Primal Incarnates](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Primal_Incarnates "Primal Incarnates").

Khadgar was visited in Karazhan by [Kalecgos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalecgos "Kalecgos"), who informed him that ancient enemies of the [Dragon Aspects](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Aspects "Dragon Aspects") known as the [Primal Incarnates](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Primal_Incarnates "Primal Incarnates") were returning to threaten the world and seek to cleanse Azeroth of the "stain" of the [titans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan"). Realizing their oncoming threat, Khadgar agreed to rally the mortal races of the world and traveled to [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind "Stormwind") and [Orgrimmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrimmar "Orgrimmar") to warn everyone.

Khadgar and the Kirin Tor later traveled to the [Azure Span](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azure_Span "Azure Span") on the [Dragon Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Isles "Dragon Isles") to help Kalecgos and the [blue dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragonflight "Blue dragonflight") retrieve the Azure Oathstone. After establishing Camp Antonidas, they came under attack by the [Primalists](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Primalists "Primalists") [Proto-dragons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Proto-dragon "Proto-dragon"). However, with the aid of adventurers, they were able to hold the line until Kalecgos arrived to fend them off.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> As Khadgar prepared to focus on the Primalist threat to the east, he sent adventures to aid Kalecgos in his quest to reclaim the oathstone.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> After they claimed the Azure Archives and Kalec sent out a call to the other blue dragons for them to arrive, the pair were approached by Khadgar. He subsequently revealed that the Primalists were on the move and that [Raszageth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Raszageth "Raszageth") was personally leading them on an all-out assault on Vakthros. As Vakthros was connected to the major ley lines of the region, its destruction would destroy the archives and span itself.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Thus Khadgar and Kalecgos headed off to handle the situation from the sky, while directing adventures to head towards Rhoni's Shield.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>

Even as the pair clashed against the Primalist, something that [Drok Scrollstabber](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Drok_Scrollstabber "Drok Scrollstabber") noted was a sight to behold, they sent out mirror images so that they may aid the champions who came to their aid.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> While they continued their efforts from the sky, they directed their allies with weakening the Primalists ground forces.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Khadgar also called upon them to rescue the imprisoned Kirin Tor mages held in their grasp.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Following the death of Korthrox the Destroyer, Khadgar and the adventurer rallied together.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Their plan was simple and direct, as Kalecgos faced off against Raszageth who was attempting to rip all the [arcane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane "Arcane") [magic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") out of the tower, Khadgar channeled his magic to replenish the [ley energy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ley_line "Ley line") within the tower, and the champion would board an arcane disc and fight off the Primalist forces that had came to Raszageth's aid. Though they were able to stop Raszageth from destroying the tower, the trio found themselves wounded and at her nonexistent mercy. However they were quickly saved by the arrival of [Senegos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Senegos "Senegos") and his brood from the [Broken Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Isles "Broken Isles"), and with the additional numbers against her, Raszageth fled.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

With the Azure Span safe, Khadgar joined the [blue dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragonflight "Blue dragonflight") in venturing to the archives and witnessing Kalecgos successfully reactive the oathstone.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

After Raszageth broke into the [Vault of the Incarnates](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_of_the_Incarnates "Vault of the Incarnates") to free her fellow [Primal Incarnates](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Primal_Incarnates "Primal Incarnates"), Khadgar, Kalecgos, and adventurers were sent into the vault to stop her by [Alexstrasza](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alexstrasza "Alexstrasza"), while she and [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu") planned for whatever was to come.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> While the group was able to kill Raszageth, they were unable to prevent her from freeing her siblings, and the group was forced to flee, with Kalecgos and Khadgar immediately returning to Valdrakken. After they had shared what transpired, Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes Alexstrasza to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that they were particularly concerned with [Iridikron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iridikron "Iridikron")'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while [Fyrakk](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fyrakk "Fyrakk") and [Vyranoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vyranoth "Vyranoth") were loyal to the Primalists ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together as one against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

## Abilities

-   Arcane Infusion

## Quests

## Objective of

As would be expected from an experienced and powerful mage, Khadgar has written a number of books and essays, including:

## Age and appearance

### Age

-   Khadgar was born in Year -14.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>
-   He was 17 when he became [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh")'s apprentice<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> (Year 3). The events unfolding at [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan") aged him prematurely.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>
-   When he reached Lordaeron along with the refugees, he was 19 (Year 5).<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>
-   At the time the Alliance Expedition entered Draenor (Year 8), he was 22 years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>
-   Based on the latest timeline from the _[Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ultimate_Visual_Guide,_Updated_and_Expanded "Ultimate Visual Guide, Updated and Expanded")_ provided by Blizzard, this would make him 54 in _[Dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Dragonflight "World of Warcraft: Dragonflight")_.

### Appearance

Originally, it was said that the spell Medivh used on Khadgar was reversed over time, his ability to use magic returned, as he did his agility, endurance, and strength, but his aged appearance remained.<sup id="cite_ref-ToD10_19-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-ToD10-19">[19]</a></sup> However later sources have changed this slightly. Most recent lore states that the life was literally drained from his body by Sargeras, instantly aging him into an old man.<sup id="cite_ref-wowcv2_18-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-wowcv2-18">[18]</a></sup> Although his body is now old and fragile, his mind remained that of a teenager.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

In _[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness "Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness")_ and _[Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Beyond_the_Dark_Portal "Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal")_, Khadgar appears as a middle-aged man with a trimmed goatee and cropped red hair. Later in the game, he is shown to have a strip of white going through his hair and a longer greying beard (much as in the artwork of the _[Shadows & Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_%26_Light "Shadows & Light")_ RPG book).

In _[World of Warcraft](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")_, Khadgar uses the classic archmage model. The monument erected in his honor in the [Valley of Heroes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_Heroes "Valley of Heroes") thus depicts him as an old archmage with a long, white beard. His appearance during _[World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade")_ matches this appearance. He, again, looks this way in [World of Warcraft: The Comic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Comic "World of Warcraft: The Comic").

In _[Warlords of Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlords_of_Draenor "Warlords of Draenor")_ and [Chronicle Volume 2](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chronicle_Volume_2 "Chronicle Volume 2") however, Khadgar looks significantly younger than his _World of Warcraft_ appearance, and looks closer to his _Warcraft II_ self. [Dave Kosak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dave_Kosak "Dave Kosak") stated that Khadgar had not de-aged, he was just freshly shaven.<sup id="cite_ref-shaved_33-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-shaved-33">[33]</a></sup> His age now finally matches his physique, as a man nearing his fifties. The reason the change was made was in order to have him look more like his [movie](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_(film) "Warcraft (film)") [counterpart](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar_(film_universe) "Khadgar (film universe)").<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

This de-aging is referenced in _[Exploring Azeroth: The Eastern Kingdoms](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Exploring_Azeroth:_The_Eastern_Kingdoms "World of Warcraft: Exploring Azeroth: The Eastern Kingdoms")_ where [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw") notes that when asked about the fact that he seemed younger, Khadgar smiles but never responds.

Khadgar has pale blue eyes.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

Valley of Heroes

Archmage Khadgar has since been immortalized in stone, along with the other leaders from the expeditionary force, in the [Valley of Heroes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_Heroes "Valley of Heroes") in [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind "Stormwind").

Archmage Khadgar of the Kirin Tor

  
Former apprentice of Medivh. Supreme Commander of the Alliance Expedition that marched into the orc homeworld of Draenor. Presumed deceased.

  
Never did one so selflessly delve into the dark heart of magic and warfare. We wish you well, bold wanderer. Wherever you are.

  
\- [Antonidas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antonidas "Antonidas") - Archmage of Dalaran

## Letters

When players reach level 100, Khadgar sends them a letter acknowledging this.

Time to Go on the Offensive

Congratulations on your achievements, <name>! We have established a foothold on Draenor and forged new alliances with this world's inhabitants.

But Azeroth remains in jeopardy. So long as the Iron Horde churns out war machines and Grommash still draws breath, our world is in peril. Continue to strengthen your garrison and recruit your fellow heroes to take the fight to the Iron Horde and all their allies. The fates of two worlds hang in the balance.

Azeroth looks to you, commander. Dot not waver.

   - Archmage Khadgar

### The Last Guardian

-   "[You](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh") come from a spellcaster heritage.

Your mother was [Aegwynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegwynn "Aegwynn"), which may be a title as opposed to a name, one that goes back at least eight hundred years. You grew up in Azeroth and know [King Llane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Llane_Wrynn_I "Llane Wrynn I") and [Lord Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Lothar "Anduin Lothar") from your childhood. Beyond that... nothing."

Initial Shattrath City gossip

The naaru are wise beyond our understanding. I've learned more from A'dal in the last five months than all the years I spent in the libraries of Dalaran.

After touring Shattrath with his servant, this conversation opens with Khadgar

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) I've heard your name spoken only in whispers, mage. Who are you?

I am Khadgar, former apprentice to the fallen [Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal"), [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"). I'm sure you've heard his name before.

It was I who discovered that Medivh had been possessed by the Evil One, [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras") - and that he had opened the Dark Portal between this world and Azeroth. Though I honored my Master, I was forced to slay him and put his tortured soul to rest.

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) Go on, please.

I fought alongside Lord [Anduin Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Lothar "Anduin Lothar") as we drove the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde") from our lands in Azeroth. As the heir of Medivh's legacy, I could do no less.

When the call finally came to invade this grim world - and put an end to the orcs' evil forever - I stepped forward along with my friends [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon"), [Alleria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner"), [Danath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Danath_Trollbane "Danath Trollbane") and [Kurdran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kurdran_Wildhammer "Kurdran Wildhammer").

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) I see.

My comrades and I called ourselves the [Sons of Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sons_of_Lothar "Sons of Lothar") - in honor of the greatest, most selfless man we ever knew. We gave our all to defeat [Ner'zhul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ner%27zhul "Ner'zhul") and end his madness.

As this doomed world fell apart around us, we shattered the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") to prevent any further harm from befalling our beloved Azeroth.

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) What did you do then?

Trapped in this broken wasteland, we did our best to survive. Over time we sensed that a new evil was closing in around us from the [Twisting Nether](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twisting_Nether "Twisting Nether"). More foul than the [dark orcs](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fel_orc "Fel orc") - it was the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") itself that sought to take hold of this... Outland.

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) What happened next?

While my comrades held the line against the encroaching darkness, I used my magic to reach out into the [Great Dark Beyond](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Dark_Beyond "Great Dark Beyond"). There, I sensed beings of immense [Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light "Light") - of unfathomable purity.

It was [A'dal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A%27dal "A'dal") and his naaru I had found. It was nothing short of... a miracle.

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) I see.

<Khadgar grins to himself>

I convinced A'dal and his brethren to return here with me. I believe that only their power can drive the Legion from this universe. But as you will no doubt find - their power must first live in our hearts.

To combat the darkness, we must become beacons of their eternal Light.

### Preparing to enter the Dark Portal

At this point, we are just waiting for an opening. Once the stream of enemies abates, we make our move.

Greeting

-   Knowledge is power.
-   Hmmm.
-   We will find a way through this.
-   Observe and reflect.
-   There is much we can learn here.

Pissed

-   Nothing up my sleeve.
-   Oh look, there's a copper piece right behind your ear!
-   I do parties!
-   In fact, I AM the party!

Farewell

-   Be vigilant, friend.
-   Keep your guard up.
-   Come back in one piece.
-   For Azeroth!

#### Assault on the Dark Portal

Dark Portal

Our forces are faltering, and my energy is waning, <name>. W have precious little time left before we are onverwhelmed.

Heartblood

Our allies can only buy us so much time before the entirety of that... Iron Horde is upon our camp.

We have to keep moving.

Blackrock Quarry

We are nearly free of Tanaan's grasp. Stay focused now, <name>.

Lunarfall, Shadowmoon Valley

So, this is where we will build your garrison.

Have youb commanded this many troops before?

I'm sure you'll do fine... I hope.

Gul'dan's Horde is ready for us. A full-frontal assault would be costly at best and suicide at worst.

There's got to be another way...

Garrison Shipyard

With your base fully constructed and your army in place, we can finally bring this campaign to a close. All that remains is the fortified bastion of Hellfire Citadel...

#### Southwind Shore and Frostwall

The threat on Draenor is one that impacts us all. I am glad that at least a few of you have agreed to work together against such great odds.

#### Throm'var

Gul'dan's slippery one.

Don't let it get you down, commander. We'll catch him.

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) Remind me about the time we used the All-Seeing Ring to spy on Gul'dan and the Shadow Council.

#### The Battle for Shattrath

If we are able to repel the Iron Horde from Shattrath, it will be a great blow to their strategy. If we manage to take out their Superweapon as well...

#### Khadgar's Tower, Zangarra

Our campaign is gaining momentum. Both the Alliance and Horde have established garrisons on the mainland. But we must be wary of counter-attacks...

Impossible! Your ring is a handcrafted masterpiece of exquisite arcane craftsmanship, invaluable and irreplaceable!

On the other hand, [Zooti Fizzlefury](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zooti_Fizzlefury "Zooti Fizzlefury") outside of my tower here is an expert in procuring the impossible. Maybe you could cross his palms with some gold.

We need to get down there, <name>. <The Illidari / Your Illidari> need our help to destroy the Burning Legion.

Once we've done that, we can get to our business with the Pillar of Creation here on Azsuna.

Illidari Stand (difference between demon hunter and other classes)

While you are <helping the Illidari / leading your Illidari forces> in their fight against the demons, I will figure out what our next move is here on Azsuna.

We must track down that Pillar of Creation. I know it is here somewhere.

Illidari Stand - quests complete

In rescuing Stellagosa, you have made a powerful friend and ally.

I am relieved that the Blue Dragonflight has survived, even if just barely. We must travel to the Azurewing Repose and speak with this Senegos.

If anyone can point us down the right path to locating the Pillar of Creation, surely it will be him.

Azurewing Repose

I will do what I can for Senegos, but I urge you to be quick about your business, <name>. I fear that he might not survive much longer.

Matters elsewhere call for my attention, and I must depart soon. However, I will return as soon as I am able.

You are proving yourself to be a very capable member of the Tirisgarde, <name>!

Our war against the Legion has exacted a heavy price. many brave heroes lost their lives in this campaign. Those sacrifices must not be in vain.

Let us seize our chance for victory!

After finishing the [Cathedral of Eternal Night](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Eternal_Night "Cathedral of Eternal Night")

I admit I am intrigued by the [vision of Aegwynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Image_of_Aegwynn "Image of Aegwynn") that you encountered in the Cathedral. There is so much I could learn from the mother of my mentor [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh"), even if this manifestation is but an echo of the [Guardians](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal")<sup>[<a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Sic" title="Template:Sic"><span title="Indicates that an inaccuracy was present in the original quote.">sic</span></a>]</sup> she was.

_Vindicaar_

-   After Illidan opened the way to Argus, I was sure that we had made a grave mistake. Now, I believe, there is hope.  
    I must believe there is hope.
-   I have faced the Legion on Azeroth and Draenor, even witnessed their corruption seeping through the timeways.  
    But until the rift to Argus opened, I could never have conceived the true depths of their evil. To see how they have twisted this world...  
    They will do the same to Azeroth unless we stop them.
    -   This was changed after the developers were notified on Twitter,<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> from: "Never in my life would I imagine that I would travel to another world, much less the home of the Legion. Until Illidan ripped open a portal and I hopped on a draenei vessel made to travel the skies to take the fight directly to them. It's a good thing my hair has gone white, I suppose. Modera says it makes me look distinguished."
-   The [lightforged](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lightforged_draenei "Lightforged draenei") appear to be infused with the very essence of the [Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light "Light"). It is no wonder they have been such a powerful force against the Legion.
-   I do hope the other members of the [Council of Six](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Six "Council of Six") are all right. I mean, of course they're going to be fine. They are all powerful archmagi! Yes. This is fine.
-   One by one, we have defeated the mightiest agents of the Legion. But now we must face their true power...

## In the RPG

[![Icon-RPG.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/60/Icon-RPG.png/revision/latest?cb=20191213192632)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG "Warcraft RPG") **This section contains information from the [Warcraft RPG](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG "Warcraft RPG") which is considered [non-canon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Non-canon "Non-canon")**.

### Personality

Khadgar was once young and excited to be following the path of magic. Now he understands the dangers; and though he has accumulated incredible magical powers, he has also paid a terrible price that causes him to act as he appears — old before his time. His words are considered and thoughtful; since the corruption of a man he considered near to a father, his trust must be earned. He continues to accumulate arcane power out of a sense of duty calling him to protect Azeroth against an evil he knows all too well, and his pursuit of both knowledge and his enemies occasionally borders on the zealous.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L41-2_78-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-S&amp;L41-2-78">[78]</a></sup>

Khadgar rarely enters a battle unprepared. He will retreat when needed, only to return with more than enough force to overcome his enemies. In one-on one combat, he will initially probe his opponent while raising his own defenses, then strike decisively. He is driven to utterly destroy demonic and orcish enemies, but often settles combats that arise through circumstance by simply teleporting himself or his enemies far from the field of battle.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L41-2_78-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-S&amp;L41-2-78">[78]</a></sup>

Khadgar's Pipe of Insight

#### [Khadgar's Pipe of Insight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Pipe_of_Insight "Khadgar's Pipe of Insight")

The innovative archmage Khadgar created the first of these pipes while studying with acolytes in Dalaran. Though the pipe of insight can look like any pipe, it is most often made with a stem of gnarled wood and a deep bowl made of yellowed bone. Sometimes the bowl has mystical lettering or runes carved into it.<sup id="cite_ref-MMaM142-3_79-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-MMaM142-3-79">[79]</a></sup>

#### [Khadgar's Gem of Health](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Gem_of_Health "Khadgar's Gem of Health")

This is a flawless sapphire, set in a platinum circlet, offset by tiny diamonds. The stones seem to glow with their own mystical life. When held or worn by a character, the flickering matches the owner’s heartbeat. The first of these special jewels was created by the archmage Khadgar to help keep him alive during his trials. Since then, others have been able to duplicate the creation.<sup id="cite_ref-MMaM142-3_79-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-MMaM142-3-79">[79]</a></sup>

#### Staff of Nethergarde

This simple oak staff is engraved with arcane glyphs and topped by a globe of cloudy crystal 6 inches in diameter. The staff of Nethergarde was crafted by Khadgar while studying portal magic in the Black Morass and protecting Azeroth against another invasion by the Horde.<sup id="cite_ref-Shadows_&amp;_Light_169_80-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-Shadows_&amp;_Light_169-80">[80]</a></sup>

-   Khadgar is the [second alternate hero](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "hswiki:Khadgar") (player character) for the [mage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mage "Mage") class in _[Hearthstone](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hearthstone_(game) "Hearthstone (game)")_, and the fifth alternate hero to be revealed. His flavor text reads: _"His [statue](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_Heroes "Valley of Heroes") in [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_City "Stormwind City") reflects his heroism, not his ego."_
-   In the _[League of Explorers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hearthstone:_The_League_of_Explorers "Hearthstone: The League of Explorers")_ adventure, Khadgar's [pipe](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Pipe "hswiki:Khadgar's Pipe") is located in the [Hall of Explorers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hall_of_Explorers "Hall of Explorers") wing. [Elise Starseeker](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elise_Starseeker "Elise Starseeker") remarks that [Brann Bronzebeard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brann_Bronzebeard "Brann Bronzebeard") loves the pipe.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>
-   In the _[Rise of Shadows](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hearthstone:_Rise_of_Shadows "Hearthstone: Rise of Shadows")_ expansion, Khadgar appears as [a legendary card](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar_(minion) "hswiki:Khadgar (minion)") for the mage class. His flavor text reads: _"What do you call two minions summoned at once? Twinions, haha! Wait... where are you going?"_
    -   In addition, he appears as [one of the bosses](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Khadgar "hswiki:Archmage Khadgar") that can be encountered in the [Dalaran Heist](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran_Heist "hswiki:Dalaran Heist") single-player experience, and his  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/7d/Quest_khadgar.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20150729115753)[\[Wondrous Wisdomball\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wondrous_Wisdomball) is one of the Treasures that can be added to players' Adventure decks.
-   In the _[One Night in Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hearthstone:_One_Night_in_Karazhan "Hearthstone: One Night in Karazhan")_ adventure, a card called the [Archmage's Apprentice](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage%27s_Apprentice "hswiki:Archmage's Apprentice") is used during the [boss battle](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_Malchezaar_(boss) "hswiki:Prince Malchezaar (boss)") between [Prince Malchezaar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_Malchezaar "Prince Malchezaar") and a young Medivh. The Apprentice somewhat resembles a younger version of Khadgar, but when asked if that was indeed who the card was meant to represent, [Ben Brode](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_Brode "Ben Brode") simply responded "Perhaps".<sup id="cite_ref-Brode_82-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-Brode-82">[82]</a></sup> Khadgar himself uses Archmage's Apprentices during his Dalaran Heist boss encounter, possibly disproving this idea.

## Notes and trivia

-   After reuniting with Turalyon and Alleria on Argus, Khadgar told them that he couldn't find them after the devastation of Draenor. This seems to be incorrect as _[Beyond the Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Beyond_the_Dark_Portal "Beyond the Dark Portal")_ clearly shows that after Draenor was destroyed, they all returned to Honor Hold. [Danath Trollbane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Danath_Trollbane "Danath Trollbane") told Arator that his parents disappeared 15 years ago (from Year 26), so they would spent 3 years on [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland"). [Father Malgor Devidicus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Father_Malgor_Devidicus "Father Malgor Devidicus") also hinted that they got lost during a battle.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>
    -   The audio drama _[A Thousand Years of War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A_Thousand_Years_of_War "A Thousand Years of War")_ [retcons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Retcon "Retcon") this by having Alleria and Turalyon separated from Khadgar and the rest of the [Sons of Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sons_of_Lothar "Sons of Lothar") after Draenor's destruction. Thus Khadgar's lines are references to the new established lore.
-   While aboard the Vindicaar on Argus, Khadgar stated that he hadn't visited any other world, which is a confirmed oversight<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> as he has been in [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor") (and then [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland")) and very recently on the [alternate Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_Draenor "Alternate Draenor").
-   Khadgar was first described as a mage of [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_(kingdom) "Stormwind (kingdom)") who served and advised the kingdom during the [First War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_War "First War"), only traveling to [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") to discuss the origins of the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") with the [Kirin Tor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kirin_Tor "Kirin Tor") instead of being from there.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> That backstory was later completely erased in the novel _[The Last Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Guardian "The Last Guardian")_.
    -   Khadgar was also originally described as an "[Arch-Wizard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard "Wizard")".<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>
-   The timeline of demon hunters joining their respective leaders of the Horde and Alliance (Vol'jin) doesn't fit. Khadgar introduces himself as the leader of the Kirin Tor, yet he became the leader after the death of Vol'jin.
-   Khadgar says that he looked forward to seeing Magni again,<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> yet no real meeting between the two has ever been depicted. As such, it may have occurred off-screen during the Second War or at any point afterwards or prior.
-   His name is [dwarven](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarven_(language) "Dwarven (language)") and means "trust".<sup id="cite_ref-The_Last_Guardian_36_88-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-The_Last_Guardian_36-88">[88]</a></sup> This gave him an odd dichotomy with Medivh, whose name means "keeper of secrets" in [Thalassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalassian "Thalassian"). This led to the Magus often calling him "Young Trust".
-   Khadgar considered Medivh to be dead.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> Following his exposure to his former master once again at the end of [Return to Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Return_to_Karazhan "Return to Karazhan"), this has undoubtedly changed.
-   Khadgar is the one who sends the letter containing  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/62/Inv_misc_idol_05.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20070131031607)[\[Admiral's Compass\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Admiral%27s_Compass) to the [commander](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") after they've completed the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/69/Achievement_garrisonquests_0050.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20141002095603)[\[Seaman\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Seaman) achievement.
-   While under Medivh's tutelage and not yet a full mage, he was formally introduced to others as "Khadgar of the Kirin Tor".<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>
-   In _[The Last Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Guardian "The Last Guardian")_, Khadgar was described as quite the daring student while he was a younger [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran_(kingdom) "Dalaran (kingdom)") pupil, often infiltrating libraries to learn about arcane knowledge. He later managed to sort out the [Guardian's Library](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian%27s_Library "Guardian's Library"), unlocking many of its trapped books. During the _[World of Warcraft](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")_ beta, [mages](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mage "Mage") were able to use the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/8/8f/Inv_misc_key_05.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20060920032945)[\[Khadgar's Unlocking\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Unlocking) spell in honor of this detail of the archmage's background.
-   While [Uther the Lightbringer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Uther_the_Lightbringer "Uther the Lightbringer") had never been very comfortable with [magi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mage "Mage"), sharing the common perception that their [magic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane "Arcane") was unholy and possibly even demonic, he had learned to accept it and even respect Khadgar during the [Second War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War "Second War").<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>

-   Khadgar has an accent specific to Dalaran that he mentioned to [Medivh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh "Medivh") after having entertained a crew of Kul Tiras with it during his journey to [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan").<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>
-   He also has an herb named after him,  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/79/Inv_misc_herb_08.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20061024084726)[\[Khadgar's Whisker\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar%27s_Whisker).
-   Khadgar owns a pair of  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/65/Inv_misc_enggizmos_10.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20061020043739)[\[Goblin Jumper Cables\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Jumper_Cables). He used them to revive the commander after nearly killing them while enhancing their [legendary ring](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary#Warlords_of_Draenor "Legendary").<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>

-   Khadgar was mentioned on [Durnholde Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Durnholde_Keep "Durnholde Keep")'s bulletin board in the canceled game [Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans "Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans").
-   Khadgar was voiced by an unknown actor in _Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal_, by [Cam Clarke](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cam_Clarke "Cam Clarke") in the video [News From Outland: Crisis at Da Portal!](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/News_From_Outland:_Crisis_at_Da_Portal!

-   When [Kael'thas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kael%27thas "Kael'thas") found himself on the barren lands of the [Hellfire Peninsula](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hellfire_Peninsula "Hellfire Peninsula"), he mentioned Khadgar's mission in the homeland of the orcish Horde.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>
-   Khadgar's model prior to _Warlords of Draenor_ used female human animations rather than male ones.
-   From Patch 6.0.2 to Patch 6.1.0, projections of Khadgar<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> were added to Orgrimmar, Stormwind, and the capital shrines on Pandaria. The true reason of adding them was due to technical servers issues (such as wanting to avoid having all the 90s of a server show up in one spot).
-   Although it is unclear what his "Keeper of the Eternal Watch" title refers to, it may be the constant observation of the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal") under the scrutiny of the mages and wizards of Dalaran at [Nethergarde Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nethergarde_Keep "Nethergarde Keep").

-   Over the course of _[Warlords of Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Warlords_of_Draenor "World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor")_, Khadgar has not shown a preference for a single school of magic and has indeed shown a proficiency for utilizing multiple schools at once.

-   Khadgar appeared in the humorous video [News From Outland: Crisis at Da Portal!](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/News_From_Outland:_Crisis_at_Da_Portal! "News From Outland: Crisis at Da Portal!"), commenting on an unknown odor causing havoc in [Shattrath City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City "Shattrath City"). Khadgar was interviewed by [Strombone](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Strombone "Strombone") and said that in all his days in [Outland](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Outland "Outland") he had never smelled such a terrible stench. He said that there were refugees from all over in this city and it would be very hard to know where it comes from. Strombone then asked if something like that had happened before, and Khadgar told him about [Tobias the Filth Gorger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tobias_the_Filth_Gorger "Tobias the Filth Gorger"). Finally, it was discovered that Tobias was, indeed, the source of the odor.

-   Many players affectionately nickname him "Dadgar" because of his habit of cracking puns.

-   It is unclear how he has obtained the [Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atiesh,_Greatstaff_of_the_Guardian "Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian"), as it was last seen in [Med'an](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Med%27an "Med'an")'s possession. The most likely answer is Med'an gave it to him for one reason or another, as Med'an seems to have stepped down from his role as [Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal").<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup>

-   Khadgar owns a watch, which he used during the [assault on the Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_on_the_Dark_Portal "Assault on the Dark Portal") to reverse the death of the adventurers. During the fight with [Kairozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kairozdormu "Kairozdormu")'s spirit, Khadgar cast a spell named Call of the Timewalker. As such, he may be either a member or an ally of the [Timewalkers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Timewalkers "Timewalkers") group. He has also shown the ability to feel the flow of the timeline.<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup>

He still felt hale and hearty, and had as much endurance and strength and agility as ever, but his face was lined, his eyes deep-set, and his hair and fledgling beard a stark white.
