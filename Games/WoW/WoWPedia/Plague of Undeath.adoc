The Plague of Undeath in _Hearthstone_.

The **Plague of Undeath**<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> (**blight**<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> or simply the **Plague**)<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> is a magical affliction first conjured by [Ner'zhul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ner%27zhul "Ner'zhul"), the [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King") (under the direction of the demon lord [Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil%27jaeden "Kil'jaeden")), from his icy prison within the [Frozen Throne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Throne "Frozen Throne") in xref:Northrend.adoc[Northrend] in order to create the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge"). The Scourge was intended to be a vanguard for the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"), Ner'zhul's captors, during their attack on xref:Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth].

## History

### Third War

The creation of the Plague took some time before and during the xref:ThirdWar.adoc[Third War]. Using his will alone, the Lich King spread the mystic disease to [human](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") settlements of Northrend killing them and causing them to rise again as [undead](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") under the influence of Ner'zhul.<sup id="cite_ref-Icecrown_4-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-Icecrown-4">[4]</a></sup> Yet, the [nerubians](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nerubian "Nerubian") proved immune to the plague.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> After the wizard [Kel'Thuzad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kel%27Thuzad "Kel'Thuzad") answered Ner'zhul's psychic call, he was tasked with containing the Plague and transporting it across the sea to [Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron "Lordaeron"), where it was used to infect food supplies and distributed to the populace under the supervision of the [dreadlord](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathrezim "Nathrezim") [Mal'Ganis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mal%27Ganis "Mal'Ganis"), an acting lieutenant of the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"). Kel'Thuzad first had to gather a cult of followers to aid him in the spreading of the Plague, and for this he established the [Cult of the Damned](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cult_of_the_Damned "Cult of the Damned").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> In [Scholomance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scholomance "Scholomance"), the [Barov](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Barov "Barov") family servants were used as experiments for the plague,<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> before a devastating disease, which was not the Plague that the Scourge would employ later but an experience of Scholomance,<sup id="cite_ref-Exploring_Azeroth_8-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-Exploring_Azeroth-8">[8]</a></sup> was unleashed and ravaged [Caer Darrow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Caer_Darrow "Caer Darrow") before a visit from Uther the Lightbringer was scheduled.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> None survived,<sup id="cite_ref-Rory_10-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-Rory-10">[10]</a></sup> while the plague variant compelled its victims to wander as ghosts. According [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw"), this variant of the plague of undeath is now extinct, but he still prefers to avoid sending his agents in the region.<sup id="cite_ref-Exploring_Azeroth_8-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-Exploring_Azeroth-8">[8]</a></sup>

With the aid of his cultists, Kel'Thuzad and [Mal'Ganis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mal%27Ganis "Mal'Ganis") used the agricultural hub of [Andorhal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Andorhal "Andorhal") to ship Plague-infected grain to the surrounding towns within Lordaeron which included [Brill](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brill "Brill") and xref:Stratholme.adoc[Stratholme]. Those contracting the Plague typically die within three days, rising shortly thereafter as feral zombies easily controlled by the Lich King's immense psychic power. The [Tirisfal Glades](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tirisfal_Glades "Tirisfal Glades") suffered an impressive number of deaths when the plague swept through the region, and [mass graves](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Grave "Mass Grave") were created to hold the bodies.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> After successfully destroying the infected granaries, Prince [Arthas Menethil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil"), fresh on the heels of Mal'Ganis, came to Stratholme to find it already infected by the tainted grain. Knowing that the citizens would soon turn into the cursed undead, he proceeded to [slaughter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Culling_of_Stratholme "Culling of Stratholme") them all, against the council of [Uther](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Uther "Uther") the Lightbringer (Arthas' [paladin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin "Paladin") mentor), in order to prevent them from bolstering Mal'Ganis' ranks.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

Before becoming a [death knight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_knight "Death knight") in the servitude of Ner'zhul, Arthas succeeded in destroying all of the sources of the Plague, leaving no way for them to further spread the disease.<sup><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wowpedia:Citation" title="Wowpedia:Citation">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a></sup> 

After Arthas left for xref:Northrend.adoc[Northrend] to hunt Mal'Ganis, [Baron Rivendare](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baron_Rivendare "Baron Rivendare") sent a shipment of grain to a village of Lordaeron where [Thomas Thomson](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Thomson "Thomas Thomson") happened to be stationed at. When the villagers turned into mindless zombies, Thomas understood that Rivendare was a traitor and reported it to the rest of the [Silver Hand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_the_Silver_Hand "Knights of the Silver Hand") paladins.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

### World of Warcraft

A [Plague cauldron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_cauldron "Plague cauldron").

[![WoW Icon update.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/38/WoW_Icon_update.png/revision/latest?cb=20180602175550)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft") **This section concerns content related to the original _[World of Warcraft](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")_.**

A few years later, after the Scourge had built a considerable presence in the [Plaguelands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguelands "Plaguelands"), they set up a series of massive [cauldrons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_cauldron "Plague cauldron") with which they continue to spread the Plague directly into the air, corrupting the land itself as well as the local wildlife. The xref:ArgentDawn.adoc[Argent Dawn], a regime dedicated to the eradication of the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") menace, have discovered ways of sabotaging these cauldrons and reversing their effects, thereby purifying the chemicals within and making them toxic to the undead.

Apothecaries of the [Forsaken](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Forsaken "Forsaken") were working on producing their own [New Plague](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/New_Plague "New Plague"), which would have a similar effect as the original Plague, but will kill undead creatures as well as living ones. This will allow the Forsaken to destroy all their immediate enemies, the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge"), the [Scarlet Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scarlet_Crusade "Scarlet Crusade"), [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") and the remnants of [Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron_(kingdom) "Lordaeron (kingdom)"). Experiments on this [New Plague](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/New_Plague "New Plague") have been conducted by Apothecaries in [Brill](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brill "Brill"), the [Sepulcher](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sepulcher "Sepulcher"), [Tarren Mill](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tarren_Mill "Tarren Mill"), and [Shattrath City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City "Shattrath City").

### Wrath of the Lich King

The days before the [Zombie Infestation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_Infestation "Zombie Infestation") began, [plagued grain crates](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Conspicuous_Crate "Conspicuous Crate") started appearing in the capital cities of Azeroth because of the actions of the [Cult of the Damned](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cult_of_the_Damned "Cult of the Damned").

During the [Scourge Invasion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge_Invasion "Scourge Invasion"), the Forsaken dealt with curing the plague while the [Church of the Holy Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Light "Church of the Holy Light") pledged itself to destroy the Scourge's [necropolises](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Necropolis "Necropolis").<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

The Forsaken [New Plague](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/New_Plague "New Plague") (also known as the Blight) was refined during the war in Northrend and used by a rebel faction of Forsaken (mostly made up of members of the [Royal Apothecary Society](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Apothecary_Society "Royal Apothecary Society") and led by [Grand Apothecary Putress](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Apothecary_Putress "Grand Apothecary Putress")) against the xref:Horde.adoc[Horde], xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance] and Scourge forces during the events of the [Angrathar the Wrathgate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Angrathar_the_Wrathgate "Angrathar the Wrathgate"). In the aftermath of the rebellion, the Horde has prohibited the usage of the full strength Blight.

### Cataclysm

[![Cataclysm](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/ef/Cata-Logo-Small.png/revision/latest?cb=20120818171714)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "Cataclysm") **This section concerns content related to _[Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "World of Warcraft: Cataclysm")_.**

[Apothecary Dithers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Apothecary_Dithers "Apothecary Dithers"), under orders of [Lindsay Ravensun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lindsay_Ravensun "Lindsay Ravensun"),<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> took samples of the original Plague from the diseased bears of [Western Plaguelands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Western_Plaguelands "Western Plaguelands") and created [plague drums](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dithers%27_Plague_Drums "Dithers' Plague Drums"). These drums were deployed as bombs to kill the farmers in [Felstone Field](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Felstone_Field "Felstone Field") and undo the healing achieved by the [Argent Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argent_Crusade "Argent Crusade") and [Cenarion Circle](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cenarion_Circle "Cenarion Circle").<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

## Nature of the Plague

Through the course of his experimentation, Ner'zhul insured that the affliction would specifically target humans for "undeath". Long term affliction of the plague causes a certain reanimation of activity in the dead, as if the corpse is waiting for further commands. Those who die by the plague are only lying dormant in their graves, awaiting one skillful in necromancy to awaken them.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

Though non-human races and creatures (and even the land itself) were susceptible to the Plague, it was humanity in particular that Ner'zhul meant to scour from the world. As a result, infected flora and fauna reacted differently — symptoms ranged from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations, but rarely resulted in death. Diseased and decaying but not truly undead, these beings were not under the thrall of the Lich King. Hence, while undead representatives certainly do exist among the ranks of the non-human races, these particular agents are examples of undead created through [necromancy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancy "Necromancy") rather than the Plague.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> An example of the Plague turning a non-human creature into undead is that of the [skeletal horse](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skeletal_horse "Skeletal horse").<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

One of the few creatures that thrives in the [Plaguelands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguelands "Plaguelands") is the [carrion grub](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Carrion_grub "Carrion grub").<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> They can reach huge sizes and are immune to the Plague. A prime example of a carrion grub is [Borelgore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Borelgore "Borelgore"). The Plaguelands also have heavy populations of massive mushrooms which also seem to thrive in these conditions.

#### Demonic energy

[Jaina](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") and [Arthas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil") [speculated](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flavor_lore "Flavor lore") that the Plague contained [demonic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon "Demon") energy while investigating its initial spread across [Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron "Lordaeron").<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> They noted that the land around the contaminated grain had the life sapped out of it, exhibiting a similar effect found on [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor") and the [Blasted Lands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blasted_Lands "Blasted Lands"). Ner'zhul's Plague was a life-draining sickness<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> and victims of this Plague became limned with a sickly, green glow<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> characteristic of something tainted with demonic energies.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

During the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients") a mushroom created from demonic mist<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> infected people with a different type of plague that caused its victims to grow exploding pustules before killing them moments later.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> This plague did not resurrect its victims.

## Cure

The Plague, while established many times as a very powerful affliction, was proven to be curable at least once. During the end of the [Zombie Infestation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_Infestation "Zombie Infestation") [World Event](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Event "Event"), the xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance] and xref:Horde.adoc[Horde] managed to find cures to the Plague, even if the converted zombies themselves could not be saved.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

The Plague can not be healed or weakened by individual means, with the exception of the [Holy Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Light "Light") (regarding weakening the affliction).<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

## Nursery rhyme

_Be wary, child, of [Plaguelands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguelands "Plaguelands") plain..._

_Be mindful, child, of the infected grain..._

_For if throat is parched and of infected water sip..._

_Forever your soul will be in cursed [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") grip._

_So heed this warning, child, and if far from mother stray..._

_Let light from home's hearth guide you back your way._

#### Fungal

The Plague was originally cast and controlled psychically by [Ner'zhul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ner%27zhul "Ner'zhul").<sup id="cite_ref-Icecrown_4-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-Icecrown-4">[4]</a></sup> There are no large fungal growths around the [Frozen Throne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Throne "Frozen Throne") or the human settlements in xref:Northrend.adoc[Northrend] hit by this version of the Plague, but there might be evidence that the Plague of Undeath eventually became fungal in nature in the form of [Plaguewood](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plaguewood "Plaguewood"), where clouds of what look like spores emanate from the colossal mushrooms in the area, whose growth may be linked to the Plague. Growths on infected plants and animals also would make this possible. Early infections could have been mostly due to ingested grain, but proximity does not appear to be infectious.

Drinking from tainted water sources, such as the [Thondroril River](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thondroril_River "Thondroril River") near Andorhal before the [Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cataclysm "Cataclysm"), can also cause infection.<sup id="cite_ref-journey_30-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-journey-30">[30]</a></sup> The Plague may have either evolved over the years to influence the growth and size of lifeforms, such as the carrion worms and mushrooms. Plants and animals tend to grow when exposed to fel magic.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_Undeath#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

#### Ebon Blade

In the _[Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "World of Warcraft: Legion")_ version of [Acherus: The Ebon Hold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Acherus:_The_Ebon_Hold "Acherus: The Ebon Hold"), a few of what seems to be plague cauldrons can be seen (specifically near [Salanar the Horseman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Salanar_the_Horseman "Salanar the Horseman")). It is possible that the xref:KnightsOfTheEbonBlade.adoc[Knights of the Ebon Blade] have begun brewing their own, that the Lich King is now resupplying them with it, or it is something else entirely. Thus far it has not been shown to have been used by the Ebon Blade against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion").
