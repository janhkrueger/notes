### Ancient times

During [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth")'s ordering, the [Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pantheon "Pantheon") bestowed the [Pillars of Creation](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation "Pillars of Creation") to the [titanic keepers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan_keeper "Titan keeper") to aid them with that colossal task. Ages after the keepers had completed their work, the Pillars would become lost and scattered across the lands of Azeroth.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

### War of the Ancients

After the [Highborne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Highborne "Highborne") found the Pillars while hunting artifacts throughout [Ancient Kalimdor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Kalimdor "Ancient Kalimdor"), they guarded them in the [Vault of Antiquities](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_of_Antiquities "Vault of Antiquities") in [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar"). During the [War of the Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients "War of the Ancients"), [Grand Magistrix Elisande](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Magistrix_Elisande "Grand Magistrix Elisande") and her allies in Suramar, opposing [Queen Azshara](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Azshara "Queen Azshara"), used the Pillars to stop the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") from creating another portal in the [Temple of Elune](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> After their success and still in the possession of [Grand Magistrix Elisande](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elisande "Elisande") and her Highborne followers, the Eye of Aman'thul was used to create the [Nightwell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwell "Nightwell"), a fount of arcane magic,<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> and a shield surrounding [Suramar City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar_City "Suramar City") to protect it from the Legion.

### Legion

[![Legion](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Legion-Logo-Small.png/revision/latest?cb=20150808040028)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "Legion") **This section concerns content related to _[Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "World of Warcraft: Legion")_.**

Ten millennia later after the [Great Sundering](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Sundering "Great Sundering") and during [third invasion of the Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Third_invasion_of_the_Burning_Legion "Third invasion of the Burning Legion"), the Eye could be found within the [Nighthold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nighthold "Nighthold").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(tactics) "Gul'dan (tactics)") stands on it within the [Font of Night](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Font_of_Night "Font of Night") atop the [Nighthold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nighthold_(instance) "Nighthold (instance)")'s [Nightspire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nightspire "Nightspire"). It is teleported to Dalaran and placed on the floor of the [Portrait Room](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait_Room "Portrait Room") due to its size.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

The Eye of Aman'thul was brought to the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras"), alongside the other Pillars, in order to close the Burning Legion portal.

## Notes

-   While the titan's name is spelled Aman'Thul with a capital T, this Pillar of Creation is sometimes spelled with a lowercase t.
-   [Essence](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Essence_of_Aman%27Thul "Essence of Aman'Thul") of the titan's power now dwells within the inhabitants of the Nighthold after centuries in close proximity with the Eye.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Aman%27thul#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
-   The item itself consists of 2 rune-covered metallic rings that rotate around the user when its powers are being channeled, though a disk or half-sphere is often seen within them. The rune-covered rings appear to be the true eye, as they are what is teleported to the [Portrait Room](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait_Room "Portrait Room") and kept on the floor after  ![N](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/cb/Neutral_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20110620220434) \[45R\] [The Nighthold: The Eye of Aman'Thul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nighthold:_The_Eye_of_Aman%27Thul). Gul'dan stands on a disk, while a half-sphere is seen during the [Patch 7.2.0](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_7.2.0 "Patch 7.2.0") trailer.
-   The door to the [Chamber of the Avatar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chamber_of_the_Avatar "Chamber of the Avatar") has the same pattern as the disk within the rings. The control console of the [Last Prison](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Prison "Last Prison") also has this pattern on its facets.
