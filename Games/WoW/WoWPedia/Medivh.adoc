“I... am the reason for the Legion's return. Years ago, I brought the orcs into this world, and by doing so, I opened a path for the demons as well. For my sins, I was murdered by those who I cared for the most. Despite my death, war raged across the lands of the east for many long years, leaving entire kingdoms devastated in its wake. Now, at long last, I have returned to set things right. I... am Medivh, the Last Guardian. I tell you now, the only chance for this world is to unite in arms against the enemies of all who live!”

He was possessed even before birth by the spirit of the lord of the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"), [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras"). Under his influence, Medivh contacted the [orc](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") [warlock](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock "Warlock") [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan "Gul'dan"), and together they opened the [Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal "Dark Portal"), bringing the [Old Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Horde "Old Horde") to [Azeroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth "Azeroth").

## Biography

### Birth and childhood

Medivh's mother, [Aegwynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aegwynn "Aegwynn"), served as the [Guardian of Tirisfal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal") before him. Eight centuries before the coming of the orcs, she fought and seemingly defeated [Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sargeras "Sargeras"). This was according to the demon lord's plan, as he used the opportunity to transfer his essence into her body, where he would lay in wait.

Sargeras, now within Aegwynn, was slowly twisting her thoughts. She became more distant from the [Council of Tirisfal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Tirisfal "Council of Tirisfal"); rarely being seen by them. Sargeras amplified fears she had already had about the Council. The Council had been using its powers to manipulate the politics of the Eastern Kingdoms. They believed they had the power to prevent war suffering, for the greater good. Aegwynn believed the constant manipulations would end in disaster. She decided to not relinquish her role as Guardian, for fear that the Council could elect a new weaker Guardian they could control and manipulate. They did not completely approve of her decision to stay on as Guardian but they allowed it for the moment.

Her relationship with the Council would become more distant over the centuries. Hidden from the Council's watchful eye, Aegwynn constructed the tower of [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan"). The tower acted as a siphon for ley lines Aegwynn could gain power from if needed. She would also use the Tower as a refuge when avoiding the Council of Tirisfal. As older members of the Council passed new younger ones would join. These new members wanted to force Aegwynn to give up her powers. They formed the [Tirisgarde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tirisgarde "Tirisgarde"), an order of magi armed with ancient relics they could use to subdue Aegwynn. For years the [Tirisgarde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tirisgarde "Tirisgarde") had searched for Aegwynn till they found her refuge at Karazhan. She sealed Karazhan so the Council could never gain control of its secrets and fled to the ruined city of [Suramar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Suramar "Suramar") where she would hide for hundreds of years; all the while keeping an eye on the Council of Tirisfal.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_22-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-:0-22">[22]</a></sup>

Aegwynn would on occasion leave Suramar to watch the Council. It was one of these times that she was finally caught by the Tirisgarde mage, [Nielas Aran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nielas_Aran "Nielas Aran"). Aran would use various artifacts at his disposal to nullify her magic and slow her down. Over the course of several months, the two came at odds. However, the fighting would end when both realized each other's true nature. Aran learned that Aegwynn was not the traitorous rebel the Council made him think she was. And she learned that Aran also loathed political manipulations the Council had been carrying out.

It was not long before the two fell in love. They agreed they must work together to prevent the Council from controlling another Guardian. They decided to create an heir and pass on the title of Guardian to. She gave birth to a son she named Medivh. She locked her powers and knowledge of the Council within Medivh where they could manifest upon maturity. Aegwynn soon left Medivh in Aran's care. She went into hiding watching her beloved Medivh from afar.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_22-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-:0-22">[22]</a></sup>

Medivh had a happy childhood under his father's care close to the [kingdom's](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_(kingdom) "Stormwind (kingdom)") royal court, primarily spent with friends Prince [Llane Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Llane_Wrynn_I "Llane Wrynn I") and [Anduin Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Lothar "Anduin Lothar"). One day, while out on the road in [Stranglethorn Vale](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stranglethorn_Vale "Stranglethorn Vale"), Medivh and his friends were ambushed by three [jungle trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_troll "Jungle troll"). None were hurt badly, however, Medivh fainted after casting several spells.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> He would succumb to a coma on the eve of his [fourteenth birthday](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Ascension "Age of Ascension"),<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> awaking in the middle of the night from evil dreams, where he pictured figures giving chase through deep chasms. In a sweat, he stumbled into his father's room, and when his father touched his brow, the power his mother had given him awoke. No less than one hundred [clerics](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cleric "Cleric") had to combine their talents with his father's to contain the powers. By the time the force had subsided, Aran was dead and Medivh nearly so himself. Spanning almost ten years<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Medivh, in a coma caused by stress and Sargeras, was tended by his friend Lothar, as well as the [clerics](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Clerics_of_Northshire "Clerics of Northshire") at [Northshire Abbey](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Northshire_Abbey "Northshire Abbey").<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Medivh awoke a decade later under a facade of control and assured the clerics and the court that he was fine.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

### The Gurubashi War

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e9/Chronicle2_Medivh.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20181002180512)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e9/Chronicle2_Medivh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181002180512)

Medivh destroys the [Gurubashi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_tribe "Gurubashi tribe") siege of [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind "Stormwind").

Years after the [Gnoll War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gnoll_War "Gnoll War"), Stormwind's farmers and settlers would increasingly push southward claiming territory close to the jungles of [Stranglethorn Vale](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stranglethorn_Vale "Stranglethorn Vale"), home of the [Gurubashi Tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_Tribe "Gurubashi Tribe"). Skirmishes would erupt between the Gurubashi and Stormwind forces but the elderly [Barathen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Barathen_Wrynn "Barathen Wrynn") would refuse to order an invasion into Stranglethorn and was focused on fighting a defensive war, much to the outrage of his son Prince Llane. While King Barathen's strategy against the Gurubashi was effective it would be unable to stop every attack, one which saw slow, barbaric, and gruesome deaths delivered to the villagers of three towns in [Westfall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Westfall "Westfall"). This would ultimately prove to be the final straw of Prince Llane, Anduin Lothar and Medivh, who in defiance of his father's continued de-escalation, journeyed south to bring war to the Gurubashi. Though initially shielded by Medivh's magic the three friends would end up in the fight for their lives when they battled [Jok'non](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jok%27non "Jok'non"), a Gurubashi Warlord empowered by [Hakkar the Soulflayer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hakkar_the_Soulflayer "Hakkar the Soulflayer"). Ultimately, the three friends would prove victorious and return to Stormwind, shaken by Medivh's powers.

While none of the Gurubashi who witnessed Jok'non's death survived, it took very to the imagination for the trolls to see who was responsible. Rallying under Jok'non's son, [Zan'non](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zan%27non "Zan'non"), the Gurubashi launched [an invasion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_War "Gurubashi War") intent on destroying Stormwind. In the face of the troll onslaught, Barathen recalled all his forces to the stronghold's gate, believing that the survival of Stormwind would depend on one colossal battle. As the death toll mounted on both sides Barathen mounted a desperate counterattack against the Gurubashi. Though almost succeeding in claiming Zan'non's head, Barathen would die on the field of battle. Llane, driven by guilt, would plead with Medivh to unleash his power on the Gurubashi as he done against Jok'non. Though frightened of his power Medivh would accept Llane's request and destroy the Gurubashi forces (Zan'non included), an act that would ultimately avenge Barathen. After the conflict was over Medivh would be seen as the realm's greatest defender.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

Frightened by his powers Medivh would later journey to Karazhan and learn from his mother how to control his powers. He would gain a friend and ally in [Moroes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Moroes "Moroes"), who disapproving of Aegwynn's habit of shutting people out, would encourage Medivh to reach to invite local lords for a party after the young guardian spoke of his darkening thoughts.

Medivh, possessed by Sargeras.

Unknown to Medivh and Moroes, his darkening thoughts belonged to the dark spirit of Sargeras who began twisting his thoughts and emotions towards an insidious end. In time Medivh would become determine to stop the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") at all costs and under Sargeras's influence would discover [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor "Draenor") and the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Horde "Old Horde"). Seeing that the Horde had been abandoned by the Legion Medivh felt that it would be a perfect irony to use the Horde against the Legion. Thus bargaining with the [warlock](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock "Warlock") [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan "Gul'dan") from his chambers in the tower of [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan"), Medivh promised to provide Gul'dan the location of the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras") if Gul'dan would bring the Horde to Azeroth. And so, aided on the other side by Gul'dan's [Shadow Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Council "Shadow Council"), Medivh opened the Dark Portal between Azeroth and Draenor.

When the Dark Portal was opened by him, almost every creature attuned to magic on Azeroth felt ripples as the gateway flared to life. Aegwynn could not fathom what had happened, but she sensed the presence of fel magic and knew Medivh must have somehow allied himself with the Legion. Aegwynn traveled to Karazhan with the [blue dragon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_dragon "Blue dragon") [Arcanagos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanagos "Arcanagos") to confront Medivh about it. The tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. It was then that Medivh revealed that, as he died in battle before her, Sargeras had spirited his essence into Aegwynn's own body like cancer, lying in wait for her to conceive as he knew she would. Sargeras later stitched himself into the fabric of Medivh's unborn body so that when he awoke and realized the power of Tirisfal he would also manifest his unholy, demonic heritage.

Aegwynn was stunned as the truth set in, but she did not lose herself to despair. Instead, Aegwynn became angry and knew she would defeat Sargeras there and then, even if it meant striking against her beloved son. The battle between the two shook the tower to its foundations and sent the would-be revelers fleeing. When Aegwynn was temporarily incapacitated, Arcanagos joined in. However, despite being a blue dragon, Arcanagos was severely outmatched. Sargeras struck him down, burning him from the inside out until all that was left was bone. Her friend's death sent Aegwynn further into rage. Sargeras may have had the full weight of a Guardian's power, but she had centuries of experience. As their duel continued, Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand,<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> until Medivh resorted to draining the life of nearby all occupants of the tower in order to fuel his strength.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Now stronger but still unable to kill Aegwynn, Medivh instead banished her from his sight.

To prevent the Council of Tirisfal from meddling in his affairs, Medivh secretly began killing its members in demonic "accidents".<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> These victims included [Hugarin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hugarin "Hugarin") and [Huglar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Huglar "Huglar").

Medivh's gaze also fell upon [Arrexis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arrexis "Arrexis") and [Ebonchill](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ebonchill "Ebonchill") who set up a [camp](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_Kirin_Tor_Camp "Abandoned Kirin Tor Camp") in [Deadwind Pass](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deadwind_Pass "Deadwind Pass"). Arrexis and his followers experimented with their warding magics outside Karazhan, attempting to neutralize the tower's strange powers. The records indicate that Guardian Medivh visited the magi at this time and offered his advice. He suggested that Arrexis could apply his warding spellwork in new ways, specifically to prevent demons from clawing into the world. Arrexis heeded Medivh's advice which would eventually be his downfall.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

At some point, Medivh hosted some traveling [merchants](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Merchant "Merchant") who attempted to cheat him by selling him counterfeit artifacts. Medivh cursed them and today they are known as the [Dark Riders](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Riders "Dark Riders").<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

It was shortly after this time that the mages of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran") sent Medivh an apprentice. The Magus had already rebuked dozens of failed apprentices,<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> but something in this [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar"), a name which among the dwarves meant _Trust_, caught his attention. Time passed as "Young Trust" studied under Medivh. He lived within Karazhan with a few others: Medivh studying, [Moroes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Moroes "Moroes") serving as his aide, and [Cook](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cook_(character) "Cook (character)") making meals.

Around this time, the war began picking up between the orcs and the humans, as the orcs increasingly struck out of [the Black Morass](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Morass "The Black Morass"). Medivh was sober about this, even remarking that it was happening as planned.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Soon after the Horde's emissary, [Garona Halforcen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garona_Halforcen "Garona Halforcen"), came to Karazhan. The Magus thought that with her conflicting heritages, she would understand what he was going through.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Unbeknownst to anyone Medivh and Garona had a brief affair which later resulted in a child, the mixed race [Med'an](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Med%27an "Med'an").

Medivh and Khadgar soon crossed paths with the King's Champion [Anduin Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Lothar "Anduin Lothar") and his soldiers on a scouting mission to the Black Morass. Lothar had encouraged his friend to rejoin Stormwind's defense, though understood that Medivh struggled with the power he unleashed on the [Gurubashi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_tribe "Gurubashi tribe") years ago. The Guardian played along and feigned a fear of tapping into unwieldy magical powers, though his true intention was to buy time for the Horde to boost its strength. Lothar also spoke with Khadgar, telling him about Medivh's troubled past and asking him to act as a caretaker in addition to an apprentice. Medivh became more erratic afterward, disappearing for days at a time and being exhausted when he finally returned.<sup id="cite_ref-WoWCV2121_39-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-WoWCV2121-39">[39]</a></sup>

Khadgar would be the first to discover that it was Medivh who brought the orcs upon the lands of Azeroth. During this time, Khadgar and Garona had an audience with [King Llane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Llane_Wrynn_I "Llane Wrynn I") and Anduin Lothar, where Lothar was convinced of Medivh's corruption. Lothar, one of Medivh's best friends, led a troop of human forces, which included Khadgar and Garona, to deal with the crazed Guardian. In the meantime, the Guardian killed Moroes and the Cook. During the battle with Medivh, Khadgar—magically aged by Medivh's spellwork—held Lothar's blade to the Guardian's chest, and finally ran it through Medivh's heart. The demon within him awakened at that point, right up until Lothar delivered the mercy stroke, decapitating the Guardian and banishing Sargeras into the Nether. At the same time, Gul'dan was trying to probe Medivh's mind for the location of the [Tomb of Sargeras](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras"). The warlock was still deep within the Guardian's thoughts when Lothar and Khadgar killed him, ending Medivh's treachery and forcing Gul'dan into a coma.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

Medivh was the first Guardian to be killed in combat in centuries.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> As a consequence of the killing, the pure, virtuous spirit of Medivh was allowed to live on and wander the [astral plane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_plane "Astral plane") for many years to come.<sup id="cite_ref-DPFoS_42-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-DPFoS-42">[42]</a></sup> His body was buried in [Morgan's Plot](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Morgan%27s_Plot "Morgan's Plot") in Deadwind Pass.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

At the height of his powers, Medivh worked his magics and struggled with Sargeras in his tower of Karazhan. His powers were such that the trauma of his death laid a curse on his once wondrous tower and the surrounding area that became Deadwind Pass. The tower has become such a dangerous and accursed place, that those that venture in never return ([Violet Eye](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Violet_Eye "Violet Eye") chain).<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

### Resurrection

Though he had died years ago, Medivh's spirit drifted beyond the borders of reality, and he watched as the [plague of undeath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_undeath "Plague of undeath") started to spread in the [Eastweald](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eastweald "Eastweald"). He wanted nothing more than to warn the world of what was coming, but he had no way of communing with the people of Lordaeron. There was only one person he could reach on Azeroth, his mother Aegwynn. She had a strange dream, where she saw Medivh dressed in a cloak lined with raven feathers, telling her that he had a message for the world, and pleading with her to help bring him back to Azeroth. Though initially suspicious, Aegwynn did feel Medivh's soul drifting beyond the veil of reality, and she also sensed that it was free of Sargeras' touch.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

Aegwynn spent years building up the power to bring him back to life and she was successful.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> She revived him<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> by summoning him to Azeroth. He explained that while his spirit was wandering beyond the physical realm, he had witnessed many things. Medivh's vast power had allowed him to glimpse into the Twisting Nether and touch the minds of the Legion's demons, allowing him to learn of the [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King") and the [plague of undeath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_of_undeath "Plague of undeath").<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

Medivh, described as a trespasser, briefly returned to Karazhan. The trespasser, muttering some words, entered Karazhan through the main entrance. Once there he found a crushed [astrolabe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe") and when he picked it up he began to see memories of the past and in particular another man just like the trespasser holding the same astrolabe. He interacted with a past version of Khadgar (though it was a future version of Medivh from Khadgar's perspective). He explained to his erstwhile apprentice that with his burial in the past by Khadgar and his current return to life, the good (the Guardian) and the evil (Sargeras) battling within him had been destroyed, and that he was, perhaps for the first time, only Medivh. He then collected the energies and visions from Karazhan to be prepared for the next battle against the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion"),<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> indicating the [Third War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Third_War "Third War").

Medivh in _Warcraft III_.

Long after the Second War, a strange prophet appeared to various denizens of Azeroth, delivering a warning of a looming apocalyptic threat. He was able to appear as a supernaturally-large [raven](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Raven "Raven"). Medivh chose not to reveal his true identity, as he would've been recognized as the evil sorcerer who brought the orcs to Azeroth. King [Terenas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terenas "Terenas") of [Lordaeron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron_(kingdom) "Lordaeron (kingdom)") and [Antonidas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Antonidas "Antonidas") of [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran_(kingdom) "Dalaran (kingdom)") both consequently dismissed the Prophet as nothing more than a madman.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

He then appeared to the young [warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warchief "Warchief") of the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde"), [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall"), son of [Durotan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Durotan "Durotan") — had a dream where the [orcs](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") and [humans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") were fighting against each other while [infernals](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Infernal "Infernal") rained from the sky. He awakened and the Prophet told him it was a vision, and that he must go to the ancient lands of [Kalimdor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalimdor "Kalimdor") if he wished to save his people. Thrall consulted with the elemental spirits, which quickly advised to trust the stranger's words, and set sail to Kalimdor in the far west beyond the sea.

After this, Medivh approached Terenas's son, Prince [Arthas Menethil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil"), who refused to leave his beleaguered people. Only the young daughter of [Daelin Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Daelin_Proudmoore "Daelin Proudmoore"), and apprentice of Antonidas, [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"), sensed that he was perhaps right. When he appeared to her after the destruction of [Stratholme](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stratholme "Stratholme"), she heeded his warning and prepared to leave for the west. She set sail with a [group of her people](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Human_Expedition "Human Expedition") just as the invasion began. Thrall arrived to Kalimdor looking for his destiny, and his new acquaintance [Cairne Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof "Cairne Bloodhoof") — [chieftain](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tauren_chieftain "Tauren chieftain") of the [Bloodhoof tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodhoof_tribe "Bloodhoof tribe") — suggested him to go to **the Oracle**. Thrall fought his way through the [Human Expedition](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Human_Expedition "Human Expedition") until he arrived at the Oracle, but he found Jaina and some humans. As they prepared to battle each other, the prophet appeared. He told them that they must cease hostilities if they ever hoped to defeat the Burning Legion and escape its corruption. They reluctantly agreed.

Finally, the Prophet revealed his identity when the time came to rally the forces. Appearing in a dream to Thrall, the night elf [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malfurion_Stormrage "Malfurion Stormrage"), and Jaina, the Prophet told them that they must form an alliance to battle the common enemy. He told them that he was, in fact, Medivh, the Last Guardian of Tirisfal, and that it was his doing that brought the orcs, and, in turn, the Burning Legion, to Azeroth. Jaina, Thrall, and Malfurion became convinced that victory could only be achieved through an alliance, and they rallied together to defend the [World Tree](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_Tree "World Tree"), [Nordrassil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nordrassil "Nordrassil"). In the final hour, nature's spirits, called into action by the [Horn of Cenarius](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horn_of_Cenarius "Horn of Cenarius")' clarion call, swarmed around [Archimonde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archimonde "Archimonde"), and destroyed the demon once and for all.<sup id="cite_ref-Eternitys_End_Cinematic_51-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-Eternitys_End_Cinematic-51">[51]</a></sup>

Confident that the world was safe for now, and that he had repaid a fraction of debt for his terrible sins, Medivh vanished, to take his place "amongst the legends of the past."<sup id="cite_ref-Eternitys_End_Cinematic_51-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-Eternitys_End_Cinematic-51">[51]</a></sup> More specifically, Medivh's powers were waning and his time on the physical plane had come to an end. Hoping that the people of Azeroth would continue fighting together as they had at Hyjal, the Last Guardian vanished<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> to places unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>

Echo of Medivh in Karazhan (old model)

Medivh is involved in the [Caverns of Time](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Caverns_of_Time "Caverns of Time")' [Opening the Dark Portal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Opening_the_Dark_Portal "Opening the Dark Portal") dungeon, the second instance within the caverns opened after Thrall's [Escape from Durnholde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_from_Durnholde "Escape from Durnholde"). It is set in the Black Morass just as Medivh prepares to open the Dark Portal, and the player group must protect him from members of the [infinite dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_dragonflight "Infinite dragonflight") attempting to kill him and stop the opening of the Portal, which would prevent the Horde from crossing into Azeroth.

Medivh is also involved in the attunement process for [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan"). After obtaining the fragments of Khadgar's key from instances in Outland, Khadgar sends you to the Black Morass to speak to Medivh to enchant it so that it will open the locked gates of Karazhan; Medivh will instead give you  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/78/Inv_misc_key_07.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20060920033104)[\[The Master's Key\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Master%27s_Key). However, you must have completed the instance (Medivh must survive to open the Dark Portal) before you can speak to him and gain his key.

He shows up twice more in his old tower of Karazhan in Deadwind Pass which has been abandoned since Medivh's death at the hands of Khadgar and Lothar, shortly before the end of the First War. An "Echo of Medivh" is seen where players play a [game of chess](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chess_Event "Chess Event") against him in the [Gamesman's Hall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gamesman%27s_Hall "Gamesman's Hall"), and an "Image of Medivh" is seen in a flashback on the [Master's Terrace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Master%27s_Terrace "Master's Terrace") fighting off the blue dragon [Arcanagos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanagos "Arcanagos").

In spite of his unknown fate, he left an avatar of himself in Karazhan to give a message of knowledge and power to his son, Med'an, so that Med'an could decide his own fate. The avatar commented himself as being gone from Azeroth.

### Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects

While chasing an image of the lost Dragon Aspect [Nozdormu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nozdormu "Nozdormu") in the Caverns of Time, Thrall encountered Medivh in the form of a black raven, who somehow knew that Thrall was from another time and that he was looking for Nozdormu.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> It's unclear whether that Medivh was from an alternate timeline or the main timeline.

Medivh in _[Harbingers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Harbingers "Harbingers")_.

When Khadgar searched [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan") for information that could aid him against the Legion, an apparition of Medivh appeared, offering to bestow the powers of the [Guardian of Tirisfal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian_of_Tirisfal "Guardian of Tirisfal") upon his former student. However, when Khadgar refused the offer, the image was revealed to actually be a gargantuan [nathrezim](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nathrezim "Nathrezim"), whom Khadgar then destroyed with [Atiesh](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atiesh,_Greatstaff_of_the_Guardian "Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian").<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>

#### Pre-launch questline

A vision of Medivh made a cameo in [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan") when Khadgar reminisced about his apprenticeship, calling [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar") a [Kirin Tor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kirin_Tor "Kirin Tor") spy, just like he did when they first met. An echo of Medivh then said that that which was foreseen had come to pass and the circle neared completion. It ordered Karazhan's sentries to "attend" to the tower's guests, and his magic thwarted Khadgar's safeguards on the tower. According to [Thar'zul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thar%27zul "Thar'zul"), Medivh had opened the way to the [Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion")'s victory.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>

#### Return to Karazhan

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/97/Medivh_in_the_Netherspace.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20221129114654)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/97/Medivh_in_the_Netherspace.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20221129114654)

In the Netherspace.

When Khadgar and various [adventurers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer"), alongside the Kirin Tor, breached the Legion's defenses in Karazhan, Khadgar found himself unable to undo the Legion's magic that was binding the Legion worlds to the tower. At that instant, Medivh appeared, commenting on the many fragments of himself that he had left in the tower. Khadgar questioned his master's sudden, real, appearance, only to be told that they had to undo the binding first.

After the forces defeated the Legion in the [Netherspace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Netherspace "Netherspace"), Medivh spoke with Khadgar, telling him that he couldn't stay to fight the Legion and that he was needed elsewhere. When questioned further, Medivh told Khadgar he was Azeroth's new Guardian, prompting Khadgar to deny the power as he had already done before. Medivh corrected him, stating he possessed all the power necessary to defeat the Legion, and that power was his will, heart, and courage to face the Legion. Medivh called Khadgar Azeroth's guardian once more and stated that while it may be simpler to shut [a door](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras "Tomb of Sargeras") than pass through it, sometimes a step into [the unknown](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Argus "Argus") is required to break the bonds of fate. With that, he flew off as a raven towards the [Nether](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twisting_Nether "Twisting Nether").

Some time later, at the end of the Legion's invasion, Sargeras was imprisoned by the [Pantheon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pantheon "Pantheon") but not before he managed to mortally wound [Azeroth's world-soul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth_(titan) "Azeroth (titan)") in [Silithus](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithus "Silithus"). As the Alliance and Horde began to fight over [her blood](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azerite "Azerite") as a powerful resource, Khadgar instead returned to Karazhan to confer with Medivh. He hoped that somewhere in Medivh's ancient tomes there was an answer on how to heal the world.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

### Battle for Azeroth

The black dragon [Wrathion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wrathion "Wrathion") journeyed to [Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan "Karazhan") to find a way to counter the [Old Gods](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_God "Old God"). While there, he encountered the shade of Medivh, who encouraged him that while Wrathion could not change the past, he could forge a new legacy to leave for the future.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

Medivh in _Warcraft I_.

Medivh's death has been portrayed in at least four different sources.

In _[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans "Warcraft: Orcs & Humans")_, the player had to enter his lair and slay him. His lair was filled with summoned and cave beings: [skeletons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton"), [scorpions](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scorpion "Scorpion"), [fire elementals](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_elemental "Fire elemental") and [daemons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Daemon "Daemon").<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> [Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lothar "Lothar"), [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar"), and [Garona](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garona "Garona") are all absent.

Medivh's death was clearly described in _The Last Guardian_, where it is established that he was slain by the three listed above — with Khadgar wielding the blade that was run through Medivh's heart (and Lothar then decapitating him); this version is supported by various sources.<sup id="cite_ref-DPFoS_42-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-DPFoS-42">[42]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

In the interlude _The Last Guardian_ in the "[Eternity's End](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eternity%27s_End_(WC3_campaign) "Eternity's End (WC3 campaign)")" campaign in _[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos "Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos")_, Medivh is shown in a flashback being killed by 5 human footmen and a captain. Though the captain figure in the scene could be Lothar, Khadgar and Garona are nowhere to be seen. In _The Last Guardian_ it is, however, described that Khadgar and Garona were wearing [Stormwind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_(kingdom) "Stormwind (kingdom)") garbs, which would explain why they could be displayed as normal footmen. In _[Warcraft III: Reforged](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reforged "Warcraft III: Reforged")_, Medivh is shown being killed by a captain and an apprentice wizard.

Finally in _[Flashback](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flashback "Flashback")_ we see Medivh being stabbed through the heart by Khadgar with Lothar standing just behind.

The idea that there were more involved than just Lothar, Khadgar, and Garona is supported by _Shadows & Light_ ("...a squad of human warriors...")<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L_45_64-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-S&amp;L_45-64">[64]</a></sup> and _Horde Player's Guide_ ("A group of human heroes slowed the invasion by slaying Medivh").<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> However, both sources also confirm that Lothar, Khadgar, and Garona were involved as well.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L_44_66-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-S&amp;L_44-66">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Shadows_&amp;_Light,_41_67-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-Shadows_&amp;_Light,_41-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> In _[Tides of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tides_of_Darkness "Tides of Darkness")_ it is explained that Lothar was with Garona, Khadgar and a handful of men when they defeated Medivh.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>

Medivh holding Atiesh.

The most powerful mages focus their powers into magical staves, and Medivh was no different. His staff, [**Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian**](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atiesh,_Greatstaff_of_the_Guardian "Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian"), was possessed by [the eponym demon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atiesh_(demon) "Atiesh (demon)"), agent of Sargeras, thus boosting Medivh's already-immeasurable powers. When Medivh was killed, Atiesh was taken to [Dalaran](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran "Dalaran"), where it was revealed that the demon within killed anyone who dared try to wield it. It was locked away in a secret and secure vault for nearly three decades following Medivh's death, until Dalaran was destroyed by [Archimonde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archimonde "Archimonde"), along with the staff.

[![WoW Icon update.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/38/WoW_Icon_update.png/revision/latest?cb=20180602175550)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft") **This section concerns content related to the original _[World of Warcraft](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")_.**

Atiesh was shattered into 42 pieces—the 40 splinters of the shaft, the base, and the headpiece. The base was found by [Brann Bronzebeard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brann_Bronzebeard "Brann Bronzebeard") through his exploration of Azeroth, and ended up in [C'Thun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/C%27Thun "C'Thun")'s possession in the [Temple of Ahn'Qiraj](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Ahn%27Qiraj "Temple of Ahn'Qiraj") when the dwarf adventured there. The headpiece was located by the archlich [Kel'Thuzad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kel%27Thuzad "Kel'Thuzad"), who was responsible for summoning Archimonde in the first place. The 40 splinters of the shaft were given to Kel'Thuzad's lieutenants, spread out across his citadel of [Naxxramas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naxxramas "Naxxramas") in the [Eastern Plaguelands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eastern_Plaguelands "Eastern Plaguelands"). Even if the staff were restored, it would need to be exorcised of the dark taint.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>

[![Comics title.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/9/98/Comics_title.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/57?cb=20180928143648)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Comics "Comics") **This section concerns content related to the _Warcraft_ [manga](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manga "Manga") or [comics](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Comics "Comics").**

The base was retrieved by [Garona Halforcen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garona_Halforcen "Garona Halforcen") from within the corpse of C'Thun.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> The staff was purified and restored by Medivh's son, [Med'an](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Med%27an "Med'an"). Medivh had poured a large amount of power into the base as Med'an's legacy that would only answer to his touch.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

## In the RPG

[![Icon-RPG.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/6/60/Icon-RPG.png/revision/latest?cb=20191213192632)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG "Warcraft RPG") **This section contains information from the [Warcraft RPG](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG "Warcraft RPG") which is considered [non-canon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Non-canon "Non-canon")**.

Medivh is categorized as a [wizard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard "Wizard"). [Brighteyes](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brighteyes "Brighteyes") is rumored to be the blood of Medivh.

### Personality

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/dd/Medivh_color.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220425235539)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/d/dd/Medivh_color.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20220425235539)

Medivh in _[Shadows & Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_%26_Light "Shadows & Light")_.

Medivh’s soul constantly struggled with that of Sargeras for control of his body and mind. The fight between them was constant, and resulted in Medivh shifting periodically between stretches of calmness and lucidity and bouts of strangely incomprehensible behavior. To outsiders, he often seemed to make abrupt decisions or reverse his position on issues. When the struggle between the two souls became too great for Medivh's body to handle, he sank into a catatonic state and became completely unresponsive. These periods varied greatly in duration and could range from a matter of minutes to months.

When Medivh was in control of his body and mind, he was a friendly and wise individual. He cared deeply for a number of the high-ranking human leaders and put the needs of the kingdom above almost everything else. He had defended Lordaeron from attack many times throughout the years and has built a great reputation as a staunch defender of the land. He was not naturally biased against any of the races, and displayed a fair amount of interest in people who brought to him stories of distant lands or cultures.

However, when Sargeras was in control, Medivh’s personality shifted dramatically. He became sullen and distant, barely acknowledged the presence of close friends, and practically ignored strangers. He was secretive and often traveled to faraway places abruptly. In private, Medivh would not hesitate to do away with annoying visitors by using his spells to kill or incapacitate them. However, he was moderately concerned about his cover being blown with the Lordaeron leadership and would not act out of character in public.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L_45_64-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-S&amp;L_45-64">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L_47_73-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-S&amp;L_47-73">[73]</a></sup>

Medivh's tactics were often erratic, depending upon which personality was in control at the time. Nonetheless, the common theme with both personalities was to stay at range and harass enemies with potent spells. He often cast only a few spells and then retreated for a few rounds to strike again later from another direction.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L_47_73-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-S&amp;L_47-73">[73]</a></sup>

Medivh, the Prophet, chose to remain uninvolved directly in the upcoming war (leading some to suspect he had remained a ghost).<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

### Status as an Eternal

Medivh is classified as an [Eternal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eternal "Eternal") in the legends chapter of _[Shadows & Light](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_%26_Light "Shadows & Light")_, but the book is not specific as to how or when he reached that status.<sup id="cite_ref-S&amp;L_44_66-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-S&amp;L_44-66">[66]</a></sup> The article is mostly concerned with the period in history when he was possessed by Sargeras. This likely means that he was an Eternal only because he was possessed by one. It doesn't seem to be related to the fact he was a guardian, as other guardians are not Eternals, for example [Aranda](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aranda "Aranda").

Although the article does make a brief reference to his period as the legendary Oracle, it is not likely the reason for his Eternal status. The majority of the article concerned with the period when he had dual personalities where he struggled with Sargeras for control of his body, this includes the role-playing notes and combat section. It explains how others might react to his mood swings and personality changes. His abilities are also a combination of a guardian and Sargeras's abilities.

The book is also pretty clear that no new Eternals have appeared in modern times.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

When Khadgar killed Medivh and destroyed the spirit of Sargeras, Medivh's spirit escaped.<sup id="cite_ref-LoC_33_76-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-LoC_33-76">[76]</a></sup> The spirit of Medivh foresaw the eventual downfall of Lordaeron,<sup id="cite_ref-LoC_34_77-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-LoC_34-77">[77]</a></sup> and with his mother's help his spirit attained form.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>

It should be noted Medivh considers himself no longer a human as he was before referenced by his quote in _[Warcraft III](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III "Warcraft III")_: "I left my humanity behind long ago. I am something...different now."

## Quotes

### The Last Guardian

-   You didn't teach me very much, Mother. You were always far too busy with your duties as Guardian to actually _raise_ the son you brought into the world to succeed you. But one lesson you did impart on one of the rare occasions when you bothered to acknowledge my existence was that the council were fools. It was Sargeras who taught me what the final fate of all fools must be. You see, Mother, I learned _all_ my lessons well.
-   It's not all demons and magic in this world. Sometimes a simpler answer suffices.
-   No matter how learned and knowledgeable, how wise and how wonderful, how powerful and puissant, there is always one more sliver of power, one more bit of knowledge, one more secret to be learned by any mage. I think these two fell into that trap, and called upon forces from beyond the Great Dark Beyond, and paid the price for it. Idiots. They were friends and colleagues, and they were idiots.
-   [You](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar") did the right thing, no more or less than asked by me. But, you asked questions because you don't know much about demons, and that is ignorance. And ignorance I will _not_ tolerate.
-   Massive trauma usually will force out the life essence... (on how to defeat a demon)
-   The former can advise the latter, but the latter must be free to challenge the former, to avoid what happened to the Kaldorei.
-   The orcs are not demons. They are flesh and blood, and as such the worry of warriors, not wizards.
-   "Nature magic?""Ripening, culling, harvesting? Can you take a seed and pull the youth from it until it becomes a flower?"

-   The Sands of Time have run out, [Son of Durotan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall")... The cries of war echo upon the winds. The remnants of the past scar the land, which is besieged once again...by conflict. Heroes arise to challenge fate! And lead their brethren into battle. As mortal armies rush blindly towards their doom, the [Burning Shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") comes to consume us all! You must rally the Horde and lead your people to their destiny! Seek me out...
-   Human? Ha ha ha... <mournful laughter>. I left my humanity behind long ago, [young warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall"). I am something... different now. Know that I have seen the future and beheld the [great burning shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") that is coming to consume this world. You sense it as well, don't you?
-   I failed humanity once before... and I will NOT do so again. If [you](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terenas_Menethil_II "Terenas Menethil II") cannot take up this cup, then I shall find [another](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") who will.
-   Listen to me boy, [this land](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron "Lordaeron") is lost! The [shadow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion "Burning Legion") has already fallen, and nothing you do will deter it! If you truly wish to save your people, lead them across the [sea](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Sea "Great Sea")...to the [west](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalimdor "Kalimdor")!
-   Then [your](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil") choice is already made. Just remember, the harder [you](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil") strive to slay [your enemies](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge"), the faster you will deliver [your people](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lordaeron "Lordaeron") right into their hands.
-   The [dead](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge "Scourge") in this [land](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stratholme "Stratholme") might lie still for the time being, but don't be fooled. [Your](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") [Young Prince](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil "Arthas Menethil") will find only death in the [Cold North](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Northrend "Northrend").
-   Commendable as that may be, his passions will be his undoing. It falls to you now, young sorceress. You must lead your people across the sea, to the distant land of [Kalimdor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalimdor "Kalimdor"). Only there can you combat the shadow and save this world from the flame.
-   Destiny is at hand, [young sorceress](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"). The time to choose has come. For the fate of all who live, [humanity](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance") must join forces with the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde").
-   The roots will heal in time... as will the entire world. The sacrifices have been made. Just as the orcs, humans, and night elves discarded their old hatreds and stood united against a common foe, so did Nature herself rise up to banish the Shadow... forever. As for me, I came back to ensure that there would be a future, to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians. The hope for future generations has always resided in mortal hands. And now that my task is done, I will take my place... amongst the legends of the past. (Last words spoken)

Medivh in the Caverns of Time.

Event Begins

The time has come! [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan "Gul'dan"), order your warlocks to double their efforts! Moments from now the gateway will open and your Horde will be unleashed on this ripe, unsuspecting world.

Shield at 75%

Death

No! Damn this feeble, mortal coil!

Orcs of the Horde! This portal is the gateway to your new destiny! Azeroth lies before you, ripe for the taking!

_The leader turns to the others._

**Shadow Council Enforcer yells:** Gul'dan speaks the truth! We should return at once to tell our brothers of the news! Retreat back through the portal!

_"That key, I recognize it. That is Khadgar's key... of course I haven't given it to him yet._

_I seem to have memories about future events surrounding you and this key._

<Medivh looks at you like he's just seen a ghost>

_You have trying times ahead of you, <name>. Let us hope your strength does not fail you._

_Regarding the key, I am to hand it to Khadgar when he's sent to me. I couldn't hope for a better apprentice._

_I suppose you will need a key of your own._

<Medivh reaches into his robe and hands you his own key>

Image of Medivh battling Arcanagos.

**Medivh yells:** You've got my attention, dragon. You'll find I'm not as easily scared as the villagers below.

**Arcanagos yells:** Your dabbling in the arcane has gone too far, Medivh. You've attracted the attention of powers beyond your understanding. You must leave Karazhan at once!

**Medivh yells:** You dare challenge me at my own dwelling? Your arrogance is astounding, even for a dragon.

**Arcanagos yells:** A dark power seeks to use you, Medivh! If you stay, dire days will follow. You must hurry, we don't have much time!

**Medivh yells:** I do not know what you speak of, dragon... but I will not be bullied by this display of insolence. I'll leave Karazhan when it suits me!

**Arcanagos yells:** You leave me no alternative. I will stop you by force if you won't listen to reason.

_Arcanagos glows with a blue aura as Medivh casts a pyroblast that reflects off the dragon. Injured, Medivh stands back to his feet._

Medivh begins to cast a spell of great power, weaving his own essence into the magic.

_Arcanagos begins to burn._

**Arcanagos yells:** What have you done, wizard? This cannot be! I'm burning from... within!

_Arcanagos flies off into the distance aflame._

**Medivh says:** He should not have angered me. I must go... recover my strength now...

## Age

The game manuals for _Warcraft: Orcs & Humans_ and _Warcraft II_ stated that Medivh was born 45 years [BDP](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/BDP "BDP").

## Notes and trivia

-   He was called **Med** by [Anduin Lothar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin_Lothar "Anduin Lothar").
-   The  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/7/78/Inv_jewelry_necklace_95.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20120621144027)[\[Amulet of the Last Guardian\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Amulet_of_the_Last_Guardian) and the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/4/43/Inv_cape_legionendgame_c_01.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20160617154445)[\[Wine-Stained Mantle\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wine-Stained_Mantle), forming the Burden of Power set, belonged to Medivh.
-   Medivh was the only human [Deathwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing") respected and perhaps even feared.<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>
-   It was originally stated that Medivh's coma lasted for 6 years.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> It was later [retconned](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Retcon "Retcon") to 20,<sup id="cite_ref-UVG_74_8-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-UVG_74-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> until _[World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Chronicle_Volume_2 "World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2")_ changed it to almost 10.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>
-   The [Return to Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Return_to_Karazhan "Return to Karazhan") dungeon features visions of Medivh killing Nielas Aran as well as Llane and Lothar watching over Medivh in his coma, events that in reality happened in [Stormwind Keep](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_Keep "Stormwind Keep") and [Northshire Abbey](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Northshire_Abbey "Northshire Abbey") rather than Karazhan.
-   In _[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans "Warcraft: Orcs & Humans")_, Medivh was a bearded old wizard who summoned the orcs to Azeroth because he was seeing the humans of Stormwind as the only barrier between him and true power.<sup><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wowpedia:Citation" title="Wowpedia:Citation">[<i>citation needed</i>]</a></sup> 
-   Khadgar learned several tricks from Medivh, including transformation into a raven.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> He later said that it is Atiesh that allows its wielder to transform into a raven.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> However, Medivh turns into a raven without Atiesh in Return to Karazhan.
    -   During the development of _Warcraft III_, Blizzard played with several ideas such as having Medivh's cloak be an ancient [night elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf") artifact that turns the wearer into a raven.
-   A black raven can be seen endlessly circling Karazhan. A black raven also appears on the loading screens for the [Karazhan raid](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karazhan_(raid) "Karazhan (raid)") and Return to Karazhan.
-   At the time of _Warcraft III'_s release, the developers themselves were not entirely sure whether Medivh was alive during the events of the Third War or if he was some kind of revenant from the past.
-    ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/1/15/Inv_misc_coin_18.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20080911133152)[\[Medivh's Silver Coin\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh%27s_Silver_Coin) can be fished from the [Dalaran Fountain](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dalaran_Fountain "Dalaran Fountain").
-   _[The Last Guardian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Guardian "The Last Guardian")_ describes Medivh as having green eyes like his mother, but he is depicted with brown eyes in the games and artwork.
    -   It could be speculated that the green color was a result of Sargeras' possession.
-   While he was possessed by Sargeras, Medivh made several victims and experiments:
    -   He was responsible for summoning [fleshbeasts](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fleshbeast "Fleshbeast") into the world. He used them in his clandestine experiments in the laboratories of Karazhan.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>
    -   The [Ghastly Charger](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghastly_Charger%27s_Skull "Ghastly Charger's Skull") was one of his victims.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>
    -   According to a _Warcraft II_ map, Medivh's magics created a giant beetle which would eventually be turned into [Beetle Island](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Beetle_Island "Beetle Island") at the time of the Second War.
    -   He also showed the ability to turn people such as [a group of merchants](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Riders "Dark Riders") into [death knight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_knight "Death knight")\-like beings. Although not stated, Medivh likely cursed [Attumen](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Attumen "Attumen") as well.
-   _Warcraft III_ level designer [David Fried](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/David_Fried "David Fried") acknowledged that Medivh's [warning to Terenas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Warning_(WC3_Human) "The Warning (WC3 Human)") was extremely vague and that he should've mentioned the Burning Legion and orcs as well.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>
-   Medivh is voiced by [Michael Bell](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Bell "Michael Bell")<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> in _[Warcraft III](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III "Warcraft III")_, _[Heroes of the Storm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes_of_the_Storm "Heroes of the Storm")_, and _[Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion "World of Warcraft: Legion")_, and by [Cam Clarke](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cam_Clarke "Cam Clarke") in _[The Burning Crusade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade")_ and _[Hearthstone](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hearthstone:_One_Night_in_Karazhan "Hearthstone: One Night in Karazhan")_.
-   Medivh's model introduced in _The Burning Crusade_ was based on the male [night elf](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Night_elf "Night elf") model. He received a new model in [patch 7.1.0](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_7.1.0 "Patch 7.1.0") which uses male human animations.
    -   During the _[Warlords of Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Warlords_of_Draenor "World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor")_ alpha stage, a mysterious figure using the same animation sets as male night elves but without the long ears appeared alongside [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)") during  ![H](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/c4/Horde_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20201010153315) \[10-40\] [All is Revealed](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/All_is_Revealed). It was speculated by many that the figure was meant to be Medivh, but it was eventually removed before the beta stage.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Medivh#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>

-   Considering Medivh's appearance in [Twilight of the Aspects](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight_of_the_Aspects "Twilight of the Aspects"), it is possible that instead of seeing a past version of Medivh who had seen Thrall appearing there, that in fact Medivh had dissappeared into the timeways when he said he was taking his place "amongst the legends of the past". When Thrall appeared in front of Medivh the only significant thing to happen there was his meeting with Medivh, while all other timeways he went to had a past Thrall immediately present (barring the next one he went to in which he died as an infant in a false timeway).

-   It is currently unknown why Medivh's spirit has not moved on to the [Shadowlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowlands "Shadowlands") yet. During the [Return to Karazhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Return_to_Karazhan "Return to Karazhan"), Medivh's ghost mentions that there are many "fragments of myself" scattered throughout the tower, implying that his soul may have splintered into different shades over time.
