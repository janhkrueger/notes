**Talanji** is the Queen of the [Zandalari Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_Empire "Zandalari Empire") and daughter of God King [Rastakhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rastakhan "Rastakhan"). She is a priestess of the [loa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Loa "Loa") [Rezan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rezan "Rezan"). She later forms [Talanji's Expedition](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji%27s_Expedition "Talanji's Expedition"), a united group of Zandalari and [Darkspear Trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_Trolls "Darkspear Trolls") who combat the [blood trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_troll "Blood troll") of [Nazmir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazmir "Nazmir").

Unlike her father, Talanji does not think the old ways are always best and believes that the Zandalari must adapt if they are to survive in a changing world. While her father's advisers were wary of making an alliance with the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde"), Talanji was a staunch supporter of the Zandalari and Horde uniting to face their common enemies.

Following her father's death during the [Battle of Dazar'alor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Dazar%27alor "Battle of Dazar'alor"), Talanji succeeds him as Queen of Zandalar.<sup id="cite_ref-QTKD_1-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-QTKD-1">[1]</a></sup> Following the end of the [Fourth War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_War "Fourth War") and the defeat of the [Widow's Bite](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Widow%27s_Bite "Widow's Bite"), Talanji joined the [Horde Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council") as the Zandalari representative.

As of the events of _[Shadows Rising](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_Rising "Shadows Rising")_, she was stated to be 18 years old,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> making her 25 years old in _[Dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Dragonflight "World of Warcraft: Dragonflight")_.

## Background

Princess Talanji

As a little girl, she was best friends with [Apari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Apari "Apari"), then known as Parri, the daughter of [Yazma](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Yazma "Yazma"), with the two getting into all sorts of mischief together, and the pair had a steadfast loyalty to one another. This loyalty was so great that when Yazma betrayed the [Zandalari Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_Empire "Zandalari Empire") by siding with [Zul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul "Zul"), Apari remained by Talanji's side.<sup id="cite_ref-SR_5-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-SR-5">[5]</a></sup> After hearing of [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin")'s [defiance to Zul's call](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rise_of_the_Zandalari_trailer "Rise of the Zandalari trailer") to unite the troll tribes, she took to admiring the [Darkspear tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_tribe "Darkspear tribe") [chieftain](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chieftain "Chieftain").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Years later, now an adult, Talanji left [Zandalar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalar "Zandalar") to negotiate with the Horde because the [Zanchuli Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zanchuli_Council "Zanchuli Council") was not doing its duty to protect the kingdom and the [blood troll](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_troll "Blood troll") and their [blood magic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_magic "Blood magic") threat was increasing,<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> though she told her father that she was simply going to go exploring.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> En route to [Orgrimmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrimmar "Orgrimmar"), she and [Zul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul "Zul") ended up being captured by the [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The Horde sent a strike team, including [Rokhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rokhan "Rokhan") of the [Darkspear](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_tribe "Darkspear tribe"), to infiltrate [Stormwind Stockade](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stormwind_Stockade "Stormwind Stockade") to free Zul and Talanji. When they were cornered in the Harbor, Talanji summoned Rezan to clear a path for them. Afterward, she returned to [Zuldazar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zuldazar "Zuldazar") with the Horde and Zul. Talanji explained that her father's advisers all plot against both him and the Horde, and that if the Horde wants the aid of the [Golden Fleet](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Fleet "Golden Fleet"), they would need to aid the Zandalari in [Zuldazar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zuldazar "Zuldazar"), [Nazmir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazmir "Nazmir"), and [Vol'dun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27dun "Vol'dun").<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

### Expedition to Nazmir

Against her father's better judgment, Talanji led an [expedition](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji%27s_Expedition "Talanji's Expedition") into the swamps of [Nazmir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazmir "Nazmir") in order to combat the [blood trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_troll "Blood troll") that assaulted [Zuldazar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zuldazar "Zuldazar"). She received the aid of [Rokhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rokhan "Rokhan"), a [shadow hunter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_hunter "Shadow hunter") of the [Darkspear tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_tribe "Darkspear tribe"), as well as a contingent of his scouts and warriors. Upon arrival at the [Heart of Darkness](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness_(Nazmir) "Heart of Darkness (Nazmir)"), Talanji and the speaker of the horde see the true power of the blood trolls. They escaped the stampede of the blood trolls and joined up with Rokhan and the Darkspear at [Zul'jan Ruins](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27jan_Ruins "Zul'jan Ruins"). There, she scryed the locations of the [Loa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Loa "Loa") within Nazmir - [Torga](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Torga "Torga"), [Krag'wa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krag%27wa "Krag'wa"), [Hir'eek](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hir%27eek "Hir'eek"), and [Bwonsamdi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bwonsamdi "Bwonsamdi") - to seek their aid in battle.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Her expedition also recruited numerous [tortollans](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tortollan "Tortollan") to their cause after saving Torga's corpse from being corrupted by G'huun's herald, [Jungo](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jungo "Jungo").<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Although Hir'eek and Torga fell, the remaining Loa agreed to help her and her forces.

After a Horde adventurer reactivated the dormant [Titan Keeper Hezrel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan_Keeper_Hezrel "Titan Keeper Hezrel"), Talanji learned of the [Old God](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_God "Old God") contained beneath Nazmir, [G'huun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/G%27huun "G'huun"), and the threat that it posed if released.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

Later on, Talanji personally went with the [Speaker of the Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") to do battle with the blood trolls' leader, [Grand Ma'da Ateena](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Ma%27da_Ateena "Grand Ma'da Ateena"), their combined efforts leading to the matriarch's demise. She then ordered the [Gob Squad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gob_Squad "Gob Squad") to fire upon the reawakened [Taloc](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Taloc "Taloc"), causing it to fall deep within the depths of [Uldir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Uldir "Uldir").<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Her mission accomplished, she returned to Zuldazar.

At some point, Talanji participated in a meeting with Rokhan and [Blood Prince Dreven](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Prince_Dreven "Blood Prince Dreven") in the [Zo'bal Ruins](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zo%27bal_Ruins "Zo'bal Ruins") about the status of the Alliance and Horde in the region. She wondered why [Ranger Captain Areiel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_Captain_Areiel "Ranger Captain Areiel") from the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde")\-reinforced Necropolis did not come. After Dreven left, she expressed distrust for the [san'layn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/San%27layn "San'layn") and returned to Zuldazar.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

### Zandalar Forever

As Zul's treachery was revealed during the [Zuldazar storyline](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zuldazar_storyline "Zuldazar storyline"), he launched a full invasion on [Dazar'alor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dazar%27alor "Dazar'alor").<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Weakened and saddened by the loss of [Rezan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rezan "Rezan"), the horrors of war began to set in for Talanji. Rastakhan, wanting to protect his family and kingdom, made a bargain with Bwonsamdi for the power to defeat Zul, in exchange for binding the souls of his bloodline to the Death Loa forever. Talanji felt that something was off, but her father assured her that he had taken care of everything.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

As Zul's army of blood trolls, traitorous [Atal'zul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atal%27zul "Atal'zul") fanatics, [mogu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mogu "Mogu") allies, and [Faithless](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Faithless "Faithless") [sethrak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sethrak "Sethrak") advanced upon the city, Talanji rallied the civilians to take arms against the invaders in [the Zocalo](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Zocalo "The Zocalo"). Although the [Great Seal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Seal "Great Seal") was destroyed, Zul's armies were routed and Zul himself killed with the aid of the remaining Zandalari loa.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

### A Warchief's legacy

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/2/26/The_True_Leader_of_Zandalar.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20190207011102)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/2/26/The_True_Leader_of_Zandalar.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190207011102)

Talanji and Vol'jin.

Rokhan received word that the mad [witch doctor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Witch_doctor "Witch doctor") [Zalazane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zalazane "Zalazane") had returned from the dead with an army of undead trolls, having somehow escaped Bwonsamdi's grasp.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> After aiding the Darkspears on the [Echo Isles](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Echo_Isles "Echo Isles"), [Master Gadrin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Gadrin "Master Gadrin") requested that [Warchief](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warchief "Warchief") [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin")'s ashes be placed in [Atal'Dazar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Atal%27Dazar "Atal'Dazar"), the resting place of Zandalari kings and mighty troll leaders. Princess Talanji accepted and guided Gadrin and the Horde Speaker to the [Golden Road](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Road "Golden Road") of Atal'dazar. There, Gadrin reviewed his old pupil's many achievements and great deeds, Talanji admitting she had previously heard of Vol'jin and admired his deeds for some time.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

However, it turned out that the urn did not contain the warchief's soul, nor did Bwonsamdi know anything about where it might be.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Thus, on the Death Loa's orders, Talanji, Gadrin, and Rokhan held a séance to discover what they could about Vol'jin's whereabouts. With the presence of his old teacher and friend, Vol'jin appeared, not to reveal what happened to him, but to say that the [Shadowlands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowlands "Shadowlands") were in turmoil: G'huun's influence was spreading without the Grand Seal, and trolls of the past and present alike cried out for justice against the Blood God. The time to end G'huun was nigh and Vol'jin requested they use [his glaive](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin%27s_Glaive "Vol'jin's Glaive") to stab G'huun's corpse to draw his blood and show all of Zandalar that the old god is dead.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Talanji then accompanied a team of Horde adventurers into the [Underrot](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Underrot "Underrot") and Uldir to defeat G'huun (The Alliance was instead joined by [Brann Bronzebeard](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Brann_Bronzebeard "Brann Bronzebeard").)

After the deed was done, Vol'jin encouraged the Speaker to walk with Talanji as they presented their victory to the Zandalari people. While Talanji was initially hesitant, Vol'jin assured her that none of this would have been possible without her initiative, wisdom, and courage. As the princess gives an impassioned speech about Zandalar's victory over the old god's forces, Vol'jin claims that she is now the true leader of the Zandalari.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

### Tides of Vengeance

After receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through [Nazmir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazmir "Nazmir"), Talanji conferred with her father about how to deal with this new threat.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> They determined that while Rastakhan would defend the city, Talanji herself would lead the armies of Zandalari against the Alliance. To that end she enlisted the [Speaker of the Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") with rallying the Zandalari.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> As the Zandalari clashed against the Alliance at the Blood Gate, she gave the order to rescue Rokhan who had been captured by [Blademaster Telaamon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blademaster_Telaamon "Blademaster Telaamon").<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> With the Alliance defeated at the Blood Gate, Talanji gave the order for the combined Zandalari and Horde armies to push into Nazmir. To her surprise, a thick fog penetrated the region which prevented the two armies from finding the Alliance.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

After the reunited [Gob Squad](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gob_Squad "Gob Squad") rebuilt the [A.F.M.O.D.](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A.F.M.O.D. "A.F.M.O.D."), Talanji empowered it with the powers of [Akunda](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Akunda "Akunda")<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> and fought to retake the Zul'jan Ruins.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> With Zul'jan secured, Talanji, Rokhan, and the Speaker headed towards [Zalamar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zalamar "Zalamar") to do battle against the Alliance.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> She gave the order for the Alliance forces within the village to be wiped out in order to find the source of the fog and the Alliance fleet.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Following the death of Blademaster Telaamon, Talanji led the army to the coast of Nazmir where to her surprise discovered that the [Abyssal Scepter](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Abyssal_Scepter "Abyssal Scepter") last seen in her father's vault. Realizing that the Alliance must have taken it, Talanji sought to disperse the fog and retrieve the scepter. However, she discovered that the Alliance had attuned the fog to the artifact and thus with no other options left to her, Talanji destroyed the scepter. Following the destruction of the Abyssal Scepter, Talanji and her allies learned that Telaamon and his forces were bait to lure them away from Dazar'alor in order to weaken the city's defenses.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

Realizing that the city was in danger, the combined Zandalari and Horde army rushed back to defend the city, with Talanji among them.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Amidst the [fighting](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Dazar%27alor_(battle) "Battle of Dazar'alor (battle)"), Talanji discovered that her best friend Apari was trapped under a broken pillar. Worried for her father, Talanji made the decision to rush on ahead towards him while promising to send aid to her old friend.<sup id="cite_ref-SR_5-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-SR-5">[5]</a></sup> Talanji subsequently discovered her dying father who with his last breaths apologized to his daughter before he siphoned the power of [Bwonsamdi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bwonsamdi "Bwonsamdi") into her. Bwonsamdi himself then appeared before Talanji who demanded to know what he had done to her, unaware of the pact her father made that bound his bloodline to the loa of graves. In response, Bwonsamdi merely revealed that her father never told her about their bargain. When asked by her guards about what to do about the fleeing Alliance, she turned towards Bwonsamdi, who with his gesture encouraged Talanji to order the Horde to go after the Alliance.

During her father's funeral, [Baine Bloodhoof](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof") told Talanji that he understood the pain of losing a father and let her know that if there was anything he could do for her, she shouldn't hesitate to ask. At the same Nathanos encouraged her to channel her grief into vengeance against the Alliance. With Zandalari navy in ruins she wondered if the Horde would abandon the [Zandalari Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_Empire "Zandalari Empire") but was reassured by [Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner") that the Horde would not turn their back on their allies.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> The resurrection of [Derek Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Proudmoore "Derek Proudmoore") made Talanji uneasy as it reminded her of what [Zul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul "Zul") did to her beloved [Rezan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rezan "Rezan"). While convinced that the Alliance must be brought to justice for her father's death, Talanji was determined to not let rage blind her or make her forgot the honor of the Zandalari.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

When Baine wished to speak to [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") once more, Talanji performed a seance to call on his spirit. With all that Sylvanas had done to strain the Horde's unity, Baine had to know who the voice that spoke to Vol'jin telling him to make her warchief really was. But Vol'jin's memory had been muddled by death, denied for him by shadows that he knew were coming for his friends. Spirits of the dead attacked the seance, and Vol'jin realized Baine's question was a good one if someone was trying to have him killed for asking it.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> At Vol'jin's request, they traveled to the [Broken Shore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shore "Broken Shore") and called on his spirit there to shed some light on the mystery. As they searched, more spirits attacked them, and Vol'jin realized that that day on the Shore, something wasn't right with the way the demons' blades slipped past his guard as if the [loa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Loa "Loa") had forsaken him. Even now he still could not hear their voices, and no matter how much he called to Bwonsamdi, the loa of death was not answering. He realized that something had been helping the Legion that day to ensure that Vol'jin died.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Vol'jin, Talanji, and Baine traveled to the [Necropolis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Necropolis_(Nazmir) "Necropolis (Nazmir)") where [Bwonsamdi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bwonsamdi "Bwonsamdi") revealed that he had not been ignoring Vol'jin's previous cries for aid; rather, he had not heard them at all. They confronted Bwonsamdi to ask him if he was the one who had told the shadow hunter to make Sylvanas the warchief, which Bwonsamdi denied. Even as much as Bwonsamdi was all for war and death, Sylvanas took things too far, and besides that Sylvanas kept the souls of what she killed as undead instead of releasing them for Bwonsamdi to claim. Troubled by their words, Bwonsamdi agreed to help them find out who had really told Vol'jin to put Sylvanas in charge.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

Bwonsamdi opened a [Death Gate](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Gate "Death Gate") to one of his rivals in the ownership of souls: the [Lich King](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lich_King "Lich King"). Like Bwonsamdi, the Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Furthermore, the Lich King informed Vol'jin that he had been altered more than he realized and as neither undead nor damned he did not belong in the Frozen Throne. The Lich King sent [ghouls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ghoul "Ghoul") after them, forcing them to flee through Bwonsamdi's gate.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Realizing that Vol'jin's spirit was getting help from some other power, Bwonsamdi also sent them to speak to the [Val'kyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Val%27kyr "Val'kyr") [Eyir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eyir "Eyir"). Eyir informed the group that Vol'jin had been "touched by the hand of valor" and become something beyond even her power to forge, but whoever it was that had aided him was was not the same person who had told him to make Sylvanas warchief.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Back at the Necropolis, Bwonsamdi mused that while Eyir and the Lich King were not his only rivals they were the ones he thought most likely to be behind it. He urged Vol'jin to search not the living world but the Shadowlands for his answers. Vol'jin agreed to return to the Other Side, with the promise that if he found anything he would send word.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

### Queen of Zandalar

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/a4/Allegiance_of_the_Zandalari.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20200627233713)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/a/a4/Allegiance_of_the_Zandalari.png/revision/latest?cb=20200627233713)

Talanji pledging her people to Sylvanas and the Horde.

Sometime after the death of her father, Talanji created a new Zanchuli Council consisting of [Wardruid Loti](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wardruid_Loti "Wardruid Loti"), [Hexlord Raal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hexlord_Raal "Hexlord Raal"), [Jo'nok, Bulwark of Torcali](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jo%27nok,_Bulwark_of_Torcali "Jo'nok, Bulwark of Torcali") (replacing Vol'kaal), [High Prelate Rata](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_Prelate_Rata "High Prelate Rata"), [General Rakera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rakera "Rakera") (replacing Jakra'zet), and [Lashk](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lashk "Lashk"), the first [tortollan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tortollan "Tortollan") to sit on the Council.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> As she prepared to undergo the rite of queens and kings, she called for [Rokhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rokhan "Rokhan") and the [Speaker of the Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") to stand by her side.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> However, before Talanji could begin the sacred ritual, dissidents led by [the White Widow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Samara "Samara") rose up in protest of a priest of Bwonsamdi becoming their queen. In response, Talanji and her allies dealt with the protests by making the dissenters see reason and allowed them to bend the knee,<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> however not all chose to accept and instead fought to the death for their opinions.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

With the fighting quelled, Talanji preceded with the ritual of queens and kings. As she received the blessings of the Zanchuli Council, she, the speaker, and the Council were attacked Samara, the White Widow herself. Amidst the fighting, Talanji offered Samara the chance to surrender, but she refused and was slain.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> With blessings of the Zanchuli Council, and the enemy dead, Talanji moved forward to face the judgment of the loa.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> During the trial, [Krag'wa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Krag%27wa "Krag'wa") tested how far Talanji would go to sacrifice for her people and her commitment to defend the weak,<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> [Gonk](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gonk "Gonk") addressed the importance of the pack and its allies, specifically mentioning [vulpera](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vulpera "Vulpera"), [tortollan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tortollan "Tortollan"), and even the [Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde "Horde"),<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> and [Pa'ku](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pa%27ku "Pa'ku") tested her commitment.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> All that remained was [Bwonsamdi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bwonsamdi "Bwonsamdi"), and the loa of graves offered Talanji a chance to be freed of the pact by giving him the head of Sylvanas Windrunner. Surprised and stunned by this offer, Talanji, moved by her personal sense of honor, rejected betraying the Horde in such a manner and decided to remain beholden to her father's bargain with Bwonsamdi. The death loa merely remarked that it was a shame and gave her his blessing.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

Having passed the trials, Talanji was declared the Queen of Zandalari.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Recognizing that the Horde sacrificed for the Zandalari and vice versa, Talanji declared that only a pledge of loyalty would honor that commitment. Thus, the Zandalari joined the Horde, as its equals.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> As part of the Horde, Talanji selected [worthy champions](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_troll_(playable) "Zandalari troll (playable)") to represent the might of the [Zandalari Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_Empire "Zandalari Empire").<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> After they proved the might of the Zandalari, Talanji called them to return [Dazar'alor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dazar%27alor "Dazar'alor") where she blessed them with the [Heritage of the Zandalari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heritage_of_the_Zandalari "Heritage of the Zandalari"), encouraged them to wear it with pride, and declared them among the greatest champions of the Zandalari.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

When [Baine](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Baine_Bloodhoof "Baine Bloodhoof") was arrested and [Zelling](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Zelling "Thomas Zelling") was killed for their parts in freeing [Derek Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Proudmoore "Derek Proudmoore") from Horde captivity, Talanji felt that Baine should have been given a chance to face his accusers and answer for his supposed crime. She thanked the Horde and Sylvanas for their help but did not plan to follow the warchief blindly.

After Talanji was informed of [Xal'atath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Xal%27atath "Xal'atath") and [N'Zoth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/N%27Zoth "N'Zoth"), she remarked that Zandalar was still reeling from G'huun and that the awakening of another Old God was troubling news.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Believing that the  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3f/Inv_fish_highmountainsalmonblue.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20161022100842)[\[Gift of N'Zoth\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gift_of_N%27Zoth) would consume the Speaker's soul, Talanji directed them to go to the Altar of Akunda in the Terrace of the Chosen in order to for them to be cleansed of N'Zoth's gift.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> She further instructed the Speaker to gather their allies in order to take back the relics used to free and empower Xal'atath before they could be used against the Horde.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

When [Varok Saurfang](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varok_Saurfang "Varok Saurfang") and [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner") called their [loyalists](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") for [battle](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_War_Campaign "Horde War Campaign"), Talanji was the only Horde leader not to pick a side and the armies of the Zandalari Empire neither aided Saurfang's revolutionaries nor [Sylvanas's loyalists](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Banshee_loyalists "Banshee loyalists").<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

### Shadows Rising

Though not a member of the [Horde Council](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Horde_Council "Horde Council"), she accepted an invitation to attend a meeting. After the late arrival, [Calia Menethil](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Calia_Menethil "Calia Menethil") explained how she was confident that [Derek Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Proudmoore "Derek Proudmoore") could have intervened on their behalf if they were intercepted at sea by the [Alliance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance "Alliance"). Talanji cut in that [House Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/House_Proudmoore "House Proudmoore") could to do nothing for them. The queen of Zandalar had not forgotten that it was [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore") that led the Alliance against her people in the [Battle of Dazar'alor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Dazar%27alor_(battle) "Battle of Dazar'alor (battle)"), subsequently blaming her for Rastakhan's death, and thus objected to peace with Jaina. Sensing her hostility, [Lilian Voss](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lilian_Voss "Lilian Voss") was quick to remind her that she had to accept that Derek was one of the [Forsaken](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Forsaken "Forsaken") and that the Forsaken were the Horde.

However, Talanji was unmoved and declared that the Zandalari were Horde as well. She then called on the Horde to respond to the Zandalari wounds and was distressed at only receiving support from [Rokhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rokhan "Rokhan") and the [Mag'har](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mag%27har_(alternate_universe) "Mag'har (alternate universe)"). The subsequent friction in the meeting forced [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") to call the meeting adjourned, where soon afterwards Talanji was the target of a failed assassination that was foiled by [Bwonsamdi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bwonsamdi "Bwonsamdi") guiding [Zekhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zekhan "Zekhan") into saving her, something the [loa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Loa "Loa") later admitted to Talanji. Disheartened by the council's response and disturbed by the assassination attempt, Talanji returned to [Dazar'alor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dazar%27alor "Dazar'alor").

The Horde Council still worried about her. Desiring her friendship, the Council decided that they wouldn't give up and empowered Zekhan, still grieving the loss of [Varok Saurfang](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varok_Saurfang "Varok Saurfang"), with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. Thus, Zekhan's arrived to Dazar'alor as the Horde [ambassador](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ambassador "Ambassador"). He arrived just when Talanji was hearing her subjects' pleas, such as allowing [Bezime](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bezime "Bezime")'s daughter [Nav'rae](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nav%27rae "Nav'rae") to wed [Khila](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khila "Khila"). Upon seeing Zekhan, Talanji declared that they could have sent worse, noting privately to herself that they could have Thrall, whom she might never trust for his stubborn loyalty to Jaina. Though tempted to send Zekhan away, Talanji decided to give him a chance which proved beneficial when he later aided her against a second assassination attempt by a war band of the [Widow's Bite](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Widow%27s_Bite "Widow's Bite") in the [Heart of the Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Empire "Heart of the Empire").

When Talanji had a nightmare about being devoured by [Shadra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadra "Shadra"), she called out for Bwonsamdi as she awoke and the loa responded to the summons. When Talanji revealed her nightmare to him, he deduced that she only experienced because of her guilt and warned her that something had to do done soon. When a vexed Talanji wondered how the Widow's Bite grew in strength so quickly and asked what they could to stop them, Bwonsamdi remarked that they were afraid of him controlling her, and they feared what his queen, a queen of death, might become. When Talanji shouted back that she wasn't his queen, the loa told her to tell them that. He then revealed that due to burning his shrines, breaking the magic that protects them, and killing priests, they have weakened him. He further enlightened her that due to her father's deal, binding them together, she weakened as well.

When Talanji asked him what to do, Bwonsamdi remarked that she already knew what to do, making her remember that she could call upon the Horde for aid. Though angered by working with the Horde for working with [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore "Jaina Proudmoore"), Talanji saw it as the only way forward but declared that if she was to abandon her pride to the Horde then Bwonsamdi shall abandon their pact. However, Bwonsamdi remarked that while it could be done, she would regret it as losing the loyalty of a god would have drawbacks. Calling her a reckless child, Bwonsamdi told Talanji that she was lucky that he was the loa he was working and not another like [Mueh'zala](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mueh%27zala "Mueh'zala"). Once more remarking that she would regret, Bwonsamdi consented to deal that as long as she protected his shrines and kept them safe, then when he was strong again their pact would no more. However, he warned that she might not like what it means to be all alone.

After Zekhan reported the second assassination on Talanji to the Horde Council, Rokhan personally arrived to Dazar'alor in order to help Talanji against the Widow's Bite. Rokhan and Zekhan then tried to get Talanji to call on the Horde for support, but the young queen refused. When [Mathias Shaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mathias_Shaw "Mathias Shaw") was captured by the Zandalari, the spymaster was thrown into a cell within [Dazar'alor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dazar%27alor "Dazar'alor"). When he requested an audience with Queen Talanji, he was ignored as she was focused on combating the Widow's Bite unaware that Shaw had discovered that the rebels were working with [loyalists](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Banshee_loyalists "Banshee loyalists") of [Sylvanas Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner "Sylvanas Windrunner"). Soon after, she was caught off-guard by the arrival of Thrall and [Ji Firepaw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ji_Firepaw "Ji Firepaw") who revealed that they had uncovered that the Widow's Bite were working together with the Sylvanas loyalists. This motivated Talanji to call her forces for direct battle against the threat by ordering them into [Nazmir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nazmir "Nazmir") as well call on the Horde for aid.

During the subsequent skirmish between the [Zandalari Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalari_Empire "Zandalari Empire") forces and their enemies, Zekhan became mortally wounded after saving children that were to be sacrificed. The young troll then fell into [Maw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Maw "Maw"), but was yanked from it and placed back into his body. When Zekhan described what he experienced, an outraged Talanji demanded to know how such a hero could suffer that fate. It was then that Bwonsamdi told them about the Maw, how everyone was going there now, and it was taking all he had left just to keep as many [trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Troll "Troll") away from there that he could.

Upon learning that her old friend [Apari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Apari "Apari") was the leader of the Widow's Bite, Talanji felt that she had failed so many, only for Bwonsamdi to remark that there was still time to protect them. In this moment of doubt and fear, Talanji asked Bwonsamdi to let her speak to her father, only for the loa of graves to deny her this telling that she needed to find her won strength, her own way. Admitting that it was strange coming from him, Bwonsamdi told her that there was always hope, as death brings life, with the great wheel turning slowly and as bodies decay new life springs from it.

Talanji grew strength from Bwonsamdi's words and rallied her forces together, which soon bolstered by the Horde. While heading towards [Bwonsamdi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bwonsamdi "Bwonsamdi") at the [Necropolis](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Necropolis_(Nazmir) "Necropolis (Nazmir)") to aid the [loa](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Loa "Loa") in battle, the Horde forces were approached by [Tayo](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tayo "Tayo"), the former lieutenant of the Widow's Bite who had grown increasingly disgusted with Apari's tactics, especially those against children. At first, the wary Talanji summoned a crackling bolt of death magic, ready to retaliate, however, Tayo defected to the Horde, with Thrall later noting that her aid proved instrumental in saving them from Blightcaller's traps, and during the fighting itself Tayo and Talanji killed Apari. Though Nathanos managed to escape the battlefield, the Horde was successful in preventing Bwonsamdi's death.

In the aftermath of their victory, Talanji celebrated with the rest of the Horde and was warmly welcomed to the Horde Council. She freed Shaw from his cell under the condition that he abide by Thrall's request to deliver the captured [Sira Moonwarden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sira_Moonwarden "Sira Moonwarden") to the Alliance, and allowed Tayo to rejoin the Zandalari Empire. At Tayo's request, Talanji allowed her to serve as the Zandalari ambassador to the Horde. She personally came to say farewell to Zekhan and informed him that when Zandalar was strong, she would personally come to Orgrimmar to visit him. She was then invited by Thrall to join the hunt for Sylvanas Windrunner when she was ready.

Following the Horde's departure from Dazar'alor, Talanji was approached by Bwonsamdi, who had come to honor his pact with her, only for the queen to decide to remain bond to him. However, she remarked that while he would still be the loa of kings, all of the loa are crucial to their survival. Due to being restored to power and being grateful to her, Bwonsamdi spared enough power to allow Talanji to reunite with her father. Rastakhan then informed his daughter that he was proud of the queen she had become. As Bwonsamdi took him back under his care, he informed Talanji that she must remember that she is the queen [Zandalar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalar "Zandalar") deserves and to be brave.<sup id="cite_ref-SR_5-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-SR-5">[5]</a></sup>

### The Vow Eternal

Talanji, with [Zekhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zekhan "Zekhan") serving as her plus one, was among those who attended the wedding of [Lor'themar Theron](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lor%27themar_Theron "Lor'themar Theron") and [Thalyssra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalyssra "Thalyssra"). During the ceremony [Rokhan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Rokhan "Rokhan") stood with them, and during the reception spoke with [Alleria Windrunner](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alleria_Windrunner "Alleria Windrunner") and [Turalyon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Turalyon "Turalyon").<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talanji#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

Greetings

-   I will do whatever I must to keep my people safe.
-   There is much to do, speak quickly.
-   Zandalar forever!
-   Times change, and so must the Zandalari.
-   I fight to protect those who cannot protect themselves.

Pissed

-   Everywhere I go, the people chant "YAAASSS, QUEEN!" A troll could get used to this!
-   I am not saying the Zandalari need to rule the world, but come on, you know you would be better off if we did!
-   My chamber walls are adorned with many skulls, but there is always room for one more.
-   Careful now, my loa is the jealous type.

Farewells

-   Zandalar will endure.
-   May your vestments be adorned with the skulls of your enemies!
-   Loa watch over you.
-   May Bwonsamdi see your enemies before he sees you.
-   Vengeance for the fallen!

### Gossip

#### The Great Seal

My father once ruled with an iron fist, and none would dare break his laws. But he was also just, helping those in need, so his subjects loved him for it.

Now? Now de iron fist is forgotten. Dose he trusts pour poison in his ear as dey plot and scheme.

I do not know what dey are planning, but I know our people cannot afford to wait and see.

Post- ![H](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/c4/Horde_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20201010153315) \[60\] [The Return of Derek Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Return_of_Derek_Proudmoore)

![Gossip](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/f/fd/Gossipgossipicon.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220125858) What are your thoughts about Sylvanas bringing back [Derek Proudmoore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Proudmoore "Derek Proudmoore")?

My father's final act was to invoke de power of Bwonsamdi. De Zandalari are no strangers to calling upon de dead to serve us.

Yet de raising of Derek Proudmoore makes me uneasy. It reminds me of what Zul did to my beloved Rezan... a foul deed that broke my heart.

De Alliance must be brought to justice for my father's death. But we must not let rage blind us... or make us forget de honor dat makes de Zandalari great.

Post- ![H](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/c4/Horde_15.png/revision/latest?cb=20201010153315) \[60\] [A Display of Power](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A_Display_of_Power)

Without de Horde beside us, my people would now be at de mercy of de Alliance. We owe much to de warchief... but we will not follow her blindly.

Baine Bloodhoof has shown honor and respect to de Zandalari. He must be given a chance to face his accusers and answer for dis supposed crime.

#### Nazmir

We must be wary. Nobody comes back from Nazmir.

#### Rezan's Wake

De idea dat any spirit could evade Bwonsamdi is impressive. It is my hope de bonds of his friends will be enough to give us a connection to him on de other side.

#### War Campaign - Blood Gate

De Alliance will fall beneath the might of the Zandalari.

#### Zandalari recruitment questline

Zocalo

Today will be a day all de Zandalari remember for years to come.

I hope it is de start of something good for my people.

Zanchul

<Princess Talanji kneels before the corpse of a priest. She clutches a bloodied charm to her chest.>

They dropped her body at my feet, <name>.

She did nothing except worship Bwonsamdi.

I brought this fate upon her.

Top of Zanchul

<Talanji scowls.>

Bwonsamdi stands where Rezan would have. De NERVE of dis mon, I swear on my father--

<Talanji takes a deep breath.>

Come. Let us finish this.
