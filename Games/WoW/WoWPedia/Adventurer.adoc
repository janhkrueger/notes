**Adventurer** is the [lore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lore "Lore") name for xref:PlayerCharacter.adoc[player characters]. They are also referred to as **champions**, **heroes**, **commanders**, and later as **generals**, **order leaders**, and **xref:MawWalker.adoc[Maw Walkers]**. Although unnamed and numerous, it is thanks to these brave individuals that xref:Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth] and worlds beyond have been saved on numerous occasions in recent times. During the xref:ThirdInvasionOfTheBurningLegion.adoc[Third invasion of the Burning Legion], one of each class was named leader of their [order](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Order "Class Order").

## Background

Adventurers fighting xref:Magtheridon.adoc[Magtheridon].

“It is my honor to provide for adventurers, for they are heroes in the making.”

— xref:Mydrannul.adoc[Mydrannul], [Darnassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darnassus "Darnassus") vendor

In the aftermath of the xref:ThirdWar.adoc[Third War], xref:Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth]'s troubles began multiplying at a rapid pace as the malevolent [Old Gods](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Old_God "Old God") subtly incited chaos and local conflicts to weaken the world's nations. It was not the heroes of past wars who rose up to face the emerging threats; it was the ordinary citizens of Azeroth. Some fought for adventure or glory, while others fought for profit or the opportunity to seek vengeance against a hated faction. Some traveled alone, while others formed mighty xref:Guild.adoc[Guild] to work together against the darkness. As the years passed, these extraordinary champions were called upon to do the impossible. Without them, Azeroth would surely have succumbed to evil.

The adventurers mostly come from the two largest factions on Azeroth, the xref:Horde.adoc[Horde] and xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance]. Death knights are part of the xref:KnightsOfTheEbonBlade.adoc[Knights of the Ebon Blade] and demon hunters the xref:Illidari.adoc[Illidari], though some of them also retain their allegiance to their former faction. As such, most adventurers are from the races composing these factions. Adventurers are mostly loyal to their faction, xref:Horde.adoc[Horde], xref:Alliance.adoc[Alliance], or the Ebon Blade and the Illidari, and will quickly respond when they hear the call to [war](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battleground "Battleground"). However, some of them have also worked for other neutral organizations as well, such as the xref:ArgentDawn.adoc[Argent Dawn] or the xref:SteamwheedleCartel.adoc[Steamwheedle Cartel], usually for [gold](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Money "Money") or other rewards.

As the skirmishes between the Horde and the Alliance continue to push the two factions to all-out war, the adventurers of the world are always on the forefront of many battlefields. While the old hatreds burn bright in the hearts of many of them, they have been willing to fight alongside one another against greater foes, as seen at the xref:DarkPortal.adoc[Dark Portal], on many occasions.

Where a regiment of orc grunts or human footmen fail, the adventurers succeed. Many are one-person armies, being able to defeat a large number of enemies and become even stronger in the process. Their strength comes from slaying foes and performing tasks as well as from the magic coming from their armor, weapons, and magical items. When adventurers work together, they combine their incredible power and defeat powerful enemies.

Nearly all adventurers have a  xref:Hearthstone.adoc[Hearthstone], a magic stone which, through some sort of strange, arcane ritual performed by an [innkeeper](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Innkeeper "Innkeeper"), allows the wielder to return to a specific location where the stone is bound to.

### The Hour of Twilight

[![Cataclysm](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/ef/Cata-Logo-Small.png/revision/latest?cb=20120818171714)](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "Cataclysm") **This section concerns content related to _[Cataclysm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "World of Warcraft: Cataclysm")_.**

After the battle-hardened adventurers of Azeroth triumphed against the Scourge, another major threat arose in year 28, the return of [Deathwing](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwing "Deathwing"). Adventurers thus:

-   fought off the elementals of Azeroth's invasion called the [Elemental Unrest](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Unrest "Elemental Unrest")
-   summoned back into Azeroth the [Ancients](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian") to aid in defense of [Hyjal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mount_Hyjal "Mount Hyjal") against [Ragnaros](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnaros "Ragnaros")'s forces
-   pushed the Twilight's Hammer out of [Mount Hyjal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mount_Hyjal "Mount Hyjal")
-   joined forces with [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") and the [Earthen Ring](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Earthen_Ring "Earthen Ring") to repair the [World Pillar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/World_Pillar "World Pillar"), battling the Twilight's Hammer in [Deepholm](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deepholm "Deepholm") to recover the broken pieces, while renewing trust between [Therazane](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Therazane "Therazane") and the mortal races.
-   the [naga](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Naga "Naga"), allied with Deathwing and the Twilight's Hammer, began waging a war against xref:Neptulon.adoc[Neptulon], in an effort to take control of the seas themselves. The Naga invaded the [Abyssal Maw](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Abyssal_Maw "Abyssal Maw") and forced Neptulon into hiding with the help the kraken of [Ozumat](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ozumat "Ozumat"). Inside the Abyssal Maw, heroes helped Neptulon as he cleansed the waters, defeating the kraken who fled the battle.
-   after having allied with [those who refused the gift](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ramkahen_tribe "Ramkahen tribe") of [Al'Akir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Al%27Akir "Al'Akir") against [those who accepted it](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Neferset_tribe "Neferset tribe"), adventurers managed to bring the fight into the [elemental lord's lair](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Throne_of_the_Four_Winds "Throne of the Four Winds") and slew him
-   besieged the dire [Twilight Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight_Citadel "Twilight Citadel"), entrance to the [Bastion of Twilight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bastion_of_Twilight "Bastion of Twilight"), and made it to xref:Chogall.adoc[Cho'gall], killing him and afterwards [Sinestra](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sinestra "Sinestra") who was hidden under the great spire
-   in the midst of this crisis, the xref:Zandalari.adoc[Zandalari], with their homeland destroyed by the xref:CataclysmEvent.adoc[cataclysm], united many of the trolls, seeking to create another [Troll Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Troll#The_Twin_Empires "Troll"). Thanks to the warning of [Vol'jin](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27jin "Vol'jin") and the [Darkspear tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darkspear_tribe "Darkspear tribe"), the adventurers managed to stop them and launched invasions of [Zul'Aman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Aman "Zul'Aman") and [Zul'Gurub](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Gurub "Zul'Gurub")
-   [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Malfurion_Stormrage "Malfurion Stormrage"), [Hamuul Runetotem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hamuul_Runetotem "Hamuul Runetotem") and [Cenarius](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cenarius "Cenarius") led a charge against Ragnaros in [Sulfuron Spire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sulfuron_Spire "Sulfuron Spire"), driving him back to the [Firelands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Firelands "Firelands")<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
-   adventurers then helped the [Avengers of Hyjal](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers_of_Hyjal "Avengers of Hyjal") at the [Molten Front](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Front "Molten Front")
-   assaulted the Firelord himself on his throne, killing him once and for all
-   helped xref:Kalecgos.adoc[Kalecgos] of the [Blue Dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Dragonflight "Blue Dragonflight") expose [Arygos](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arygos "Arygos")'s betrayal, allowing Kalec to be chosen as the new Aspect of Magic
-   went back to the past and retrieved the [Demon Soul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Soul "Demon Soul")
-   defeated the leader of the [infinite dragonflight](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_dragonflight "Infinite dragonflight"), xref:Murozond.adoc[Murozond]
-   helped [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hour_of_Twilight_(instance) "Hour of Twilight (instance)") reach the Aspects, since Deathwing, aware of the [Dragon Aspects](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Aspects "Dragon Aspects")' intentions, had launched a massive assault on [Wyrmrest Temple](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmrest_Temple "Wyrmrest Temple") to prevent Thrall from handing them the Dragon Soul.
-   using a powerful [Alliance gunship](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Skyfire "The Skyfire"), got on the [back of the mighty aspect](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spine_of_Deathwing "Spine of Deathwing"), dismantled his armor, and allowed Thrall to blast a hole through his chest with the Dragon Soul. With the assistance of Thrall and the Dragon Aspects, they defeated the fallen Aspect for good.

### Mists of Pandaria

Immediately after the fall of Deathwing and his servants, the adventurers' respective leaders dedicated their factions [completely to war](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance-Horde_war "Alliance-Horde war"). The agents of the Horde infiltrated [Theramore](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Theramore "Theramore"), resulting in its utter destruction. They later accidentally rediscovered the mythical and long-forgotten lands of [Pandaria](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pandaria "Pandaria"), a continent far to the south that had until now been shrouded in magical mists and touched by the ancient malevolence known only as the [sha](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sha "Sha").

With both factions landing on Pandaria, adventurers rediscovered the ancient xref:Pandaren.adoc[Pandaren], whose wisdom helped guide them to new destinies: the [Pandaren Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pandaren_Empire "Pandaren Empire")'s ancient enemy, the [Mantid](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mantid "Mantid"), and their legendary oppressors, the enigmatic [mogu](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mogu "Mogu").

As conflicts heated up between the Alliance and Horde, the land changed over time, with subsequent events escalating the conflict between Alliance leader [Varian Wrynn](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Varian_Wrynn "Varian Wrynn") and the increasingly unbalanced Horde Warchief [Garrosh Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrosh_Hellscream "Garrosh Hellscream"), eventually leading to a schism within the Horde itself.

As civil war wracked the Horde, the Alliance and those in the Horde opposed to Hellscream's violent uprising [joined forces](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Escalation "Escalation") to take [the battle directly to the enemy](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Orgrimmar "Siege of Orgrimmar"), leading to direct confrontation with Hellscream and his Sha-touched allies in a concluding showdown deep within the bowels of Orgrimmar itself.

### Warlords of Draenor

#### Iron March Invasion

Months after Garrosh Hellscream's mysterious escape from his trial, the Dark Portal suddenly turned red and a seemingly endless and technologically advanced army of orcs calling itself the [Iron Horde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Horde "Iron Horde") poured through it into the [Blasted Lands](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blasted_Lands "Blasted Lands"). The combined forces of the Alliance and Horde were able to push the invasion back to the portal and break through to the other side, along with [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall"), [Khadgar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Khadgar "Khadgar"), and a number of other heroes of Azeroth. On the other side of the portal they recognized Draenor - not the broken world of Outland, but a living, breathing world free of fel corruption — and an even more massive army than they imagined. Securing the immediate area, it was discovered that [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)"), [Teron'gor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Teron%27gor "Teron'gor"), and [Cho'gall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cho%27gall_(alternate_universe) "Cho'gall (alternate universe)") were imprisoned beneath and their fel magic was powering the portal to Azeroth. In a decision that would later have dire consequences, the champions chose to release the warlocks, disabling the portal.

As the Iron Horde fell upon them in insurmountable numbers, the champions fled through the [Tanaan Jungle](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tanaan_Jungle "Tanaan Jungle"). The leaders of this Iron Horde brought their forces to bear against the intruders in pursuit. Chieftains [Kilrogg Deadeye](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kilrogg_Deadeye_(alternate_universe) "Kilrogg Deadeye (alternate universe)") of the [Bleeding Hollow](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bleeding_Hollow_clan_(alternate_universe) "Bleeding Hollow clan (alternate universe)"), [Kargath Bladefist](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kargath_Bladefist_(alternate_universe) "Kargath Bladefist (alternate universe)") of the [Shattered Hand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattered_Hand_clan_(alternate_universe) "Shattered Hand clan (alternate universe)"), [Ner'zhul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ner%27zhul_(alternate_universe) "Ner'zhul (alternate universe)") of the [Shadowmoon](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowmoon_clan_(alternate_universe) "Shadowmoon clan (alternate universe)"), [Blackhand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackhand_(alternate_universe) "Blackhand (alternate universe)") of the [Blackrock](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackrock_clan_(alternate_universe) "Blackrock clan (alternate universe)") and the Warchief above them all [Grommash Hellscream](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grommash_Hellscream_(alternate_universe) "Grommash Hellscream (alternate universe)") of the [Warsong](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warsong_clan_(alternate_universe) "Warsong clan (alternate universe)") attacked the champions with their armies. In spite of the Iron Horde's defenses, the champions were able to destroy the Dark Portal on the Draenor side, buying time for leaders back in Azeroth to develop a plan to defeat the new enemies.

#### New allies

Surrounded by the Iron Horde, the champions fled to other parts of Draenor to find allies on the savage world, the Alliance champions to the draenei of [Shadowmoon Valley](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowmoon_Valley_(alternate_universe) "Shadowmoon Valley (alternate universe)"), and the Horde champions to the orcs of [Frostfire Ridge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frostfire_Ridge "Frostfire Ridge") that they learned had not joined the Iron Horde. Adventurers established [garrisons](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Garrison "Garrison") in the respective areas, and as they did so, it became clear that the Iron Horde may have invaded Azeroth prematurely, as they had not fully secured Draenor yet. Alliance champions broke through the siege of [Karabor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Karabor "Karabor") while Horde champions cut off the Iron Horde's advance in [Thunder Pass](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Pass "Thunder Pass"). The defeat of the Shadowmoon clan in the [Defense of Karabor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_of_Karabor "Defense of Karabor") provided the opportunity for adventurers of both factions to push further into the [Anguish Fortress](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anguish_Fortress "Anguish Fortress") into the [Shadowmoon Burial Grounds](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowmoon_Burial_Grounds "Shadowmoon Burial Grounds"), where they defeated the first of the mighty Warlords Ner'zhul.

With their new allies, both factions' champions pushed north to [Gorgrond](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gorgrond "Gorgrond") in the hopes of bringing the fight to the Iron Horde's facilities in the region. The champions discovered powerful [Titan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Titan "Titan") artifacts and used them to break the Iron Horde's defenses at the [Iron Docks](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Docks "Iron Docks") and eventually took the facility and the nearby [Grimrail Depot](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grimrail_Depot "Grimrail Depot"). The champions also destroyed the Kirin Tor camp in the [Everbloom](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Everbloom "Everbloom"), which had been infested by the native [Primals](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Primals "Primals") hostile to both sides.

#### Talador and the arakkoa

The champions continued to augment their forces with heroes from Draenor and Azeroth and expanded their garrisons to formidable fortresses for the battle ahead. Both then pushed into the heart of the continent, [Talador](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talador "Talador"), where they liberated [Shattrath City](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City_(alternate_universe) "Shattrath City (alternate universe)") from the Iron Horde's forces under the command of [Orgrim Doomhammer](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orgrim_Doomhammer_(alternate_universe) "Orgrim Doomhammer (alternate universe)") and Blackhand. During the battle, Blackhand killed Doomhammer for insubordination, but even as his fleet lay broken he escaped back to Gorgrond. The champions then pushed south to break the siege of [Auchindoun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Auchindoun_(alternate_universe) "Auchindoun (alternate universe)") by [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe) "Gul'dan (alternate universe)"), [Teron'gor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Teron%27gor "Teron'gor") and their allies who had intended to use the souls in repose there for their own ends.

The champions then traveled even further south to the [Spires of Arak](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spires_of_Arak "Spires of Arak") to assist the [Arakkoa Outcasts](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arakkoa_Outcasts "Arakkoa Outcasts") in their insurgency against the [Adherents of Rukhmar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adherents_of_Rukhmar "Adherents of Rukhmar"). The Adherents' leader, [High Sage Viryx](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/High_Sage_Viryx "High Sage Viryx"), was defeated in [Skyreach](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skyreach "Skyreach"), and the Outcasts summoned the spirit of [Terokk](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Terokk_(alternate_universe) "Terokk (alternate universe)") to help the champions repel the advance of the Shattered Hand into the region. Kargath Bladefist, however, was able to defeat Terokk even as his forces were forced to retreat.

#### Nagrand and the Blackrock Foundry

The champions then advanced west to the rolling plains of Nagrand, where they found the Warsong clan led by the fugitive Garrosh from their own world, who had forged an alliance with the [Gorian Empire](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gorian_Empire "Gorian Empire") capital of [Highmaul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Highmaul "Highmaul"). The champions pushed into the Warsong capital of [Grommashar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grommashar "Grommashar") but were subdued by Garrosh. [Thrall](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thrall "Thrall") rescued the defeated champions and killed Garrosh in [mak'gora](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mak%27gora "Mak'gora"). The champions then turned their attention to [Oshu'gun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Oshu%27gun_(alternate_universe) "Oshu'gun (alternate universe)") and the [Pale](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pale "Pale") under the leadership of xref:Chogall.adoc[Cho'gall]. The champions defeated the Pale, but Cho'gall managed to escape. The defeat of the Warsong left the Iron Horde in disarray in the area, opening an opportunity for the champions to invade Highmaul. Kargath Bladefist made a last-ditch attempt to defeat the champions, an attempt which cost him his life and became the second Warlord to fall. The defeat of Highmaul's leader [Imperator Mar'gok](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Imperator_Mar%27gok_(alternate_universe) "Imperator Mar'gok (alternate universe)") brought an end to Highmaul's support for the Iron Horde, as well as an end to the ogre threat. In fury, Cho'gall also attacked the champions, but was brought down by the same champions who defeated Mar'gok.

With Nagrand secured, the champions returned to Gorgrond to lay siege to the [Blackrock Foundry](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Blackrock_Foundry "Blackrock Foundry"). Deep in the bowels of the Foundry, the champions defeated Blackhand, the third Warlord to fall.

Here they slew the last member of the original Warlords, Kilrogg Deadeye, and destroyed the mutated abomination Teron'gor had become in the aftermath of the events in Auchindoun. Further on, they defeated the newly "cured" [Shadow-Sage Iskar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow-Sage_Iskar "Shadow-Sage Iskar"), rescued Grommash from the grip of the Burning Legion, struck down the revived [Mannoroth](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mannoroth "Mannoroth"), and ultimately stopped [Archimonde](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archimonde "Archimonde")'s attempt to destroy the world.
