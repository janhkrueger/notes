The **aqir** (pronounced "uh-KEER") are an ancient, sentient link:Games/WoW/Pandaria.adoc[Pandaria] race who—much like the [n'raqi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/N%27raqi "N'raqi")—arose from the organic matter seeping from the link:Games/WoW/OldGod.adoc[Old God]' massive bulks during the primordial era of link:Games/WoW/Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth]. When the Old Gods' link:Games/WoW/BlackEmpire.adoc[Black Empire] was defeated by the link:TitanForged[titan-forged], the aqir were driven underground, where they remained until they were reawakened by [Kith'ix](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kith%27ix "Kith'ix") millennia later. Obsessed with eradicating all non-insectoid life on [Kalimdor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalimdor_(landmass) "Kalimdor (landmass)"), they [waged war](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir_and_Troll_War "Aqir and Troll War") against the [trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Troll "Troll"), but were eventually defeated and split into three distinct colonies: the xref:Nerubian.adoc[nerubians] of xref:Azjol-Nerub.adoc[Azjol-Nerub], the [qiraji](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Qiraji "Qiraji") of xref:AhnQiraj.adoc[Ahn'Qiraj], and the link:Games/WoW/Mantid.adoc[Mantid] of [Manti'vess](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manti%27vess "Manti'vess"). Armies of the original aqir race reemerged thousands of years later in service to the newly-freed Old God link:NZoth[N'Zoth].

## History

### The Black Empire

After the link:Games/WoW/OldGod.adoc[Old God] embedded themselves in the surface of primordial link:Games/WoW/Azeroth.adoc[Azeroth], they soon began spreading corruption around them, blighting and withering the land. The organic matter that seeped from their massive bodies gave rise to two distinct races: the aqir and the [n'raqi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/N%27raqi "N'raqi") (or "faceless ones"). The incredibly strong and resilient aqir were employed as laborers by the cunning and intelligent n'raqi and were forced to build temple cities and towering citadels around their masters' massive bulks. The greatest of these holdings was built around the most powerful of the Old Gods, link:YShaarj[Y'Shaarj], and this civilization soon spread across Azeroth, forming the link:Games/WoW/BlackEmpire.adoc[Black Empire].

However, one day the link:TitanForged[titan-forged], servants of the link:Titan[titan] link:Pantheon[Pantheon], arrived on Azeroth to combat the Black Empire. The titan-forged were successful in imprisoning the enslaved [Elemental Lords](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Lord "Elemental Lord") and thereafter turned their attention to the aqir, many of which dwelled in enormous catacombs below the surface of the empire. The titan-forged [Archaedas](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Archaedas "Archaedas") used his earth magic to collapse the burrows, forcing the insectoids to escape above ground, where they found themselves surrounded by the titan-forged. Most of the aqir were destroyed by the titan-forged, though several small pockets survived by tunneling deep underground, too weakened to launch a counterattack.<sup id="cite_ref-Chronicle29_2-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-Chronicle29-2">[2]</a></sup>

### War with the trolls

_Main article: xref:AqirAndTrollWar.adoc[Aqir and Troll War]_

Thousands of years later, long after the Black Empire's fall, a race known as the [trolls](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Troll "Troll") rose to prominence in Kalimdor and established great civilizations that covered most of the continent. One day, roughly 16,000 years before the [First War](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/First_War "First War"), a rebellious group of trolls accidentally awakened [Kith'ix](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kith%27ix "Kith'ix"), an ancient servant of the Old God link:YoggSaron[Yogg-Saron] who had survived an encounter with the titan-forged [Tyr](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tyr "Tyr") centuries earlier. Kith'ix, knowing that destroying the trolls would please its Old God masters, reached out with its mind and discovered the aqir, rallying them into building the subterranean empire of [Azj'Aqir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azj%27Aqir "Azj'Aqir"). When the time was right, Kith'ix led the aqir to the surface, launching a terrible war against the trolls.<sup id="cite_ref-Chronicle72_3-0"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-Chronicle72-3">[3]</a></sup>

The aqiri threat was unlike anything the trolls had ever faced before. When the insectoids had almost reached the sacred [Zandalar Mountains](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalar "Zandalar"), the [Zandalar tribe](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zandalar_tribe "Zandalar tribe") united the trolls into the [Empire of Zul](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Empire_of_Zul "Empire of Zul") to fight back against the legions of Azj'Aqir. Ambush tactics and the aid of the [Wild Gods](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_God "Wild God") helped the trolls in pushing back the insectoids and even wounding Kith'ix, who retreated with a group of its closest followers to the northeastern corner of the [continent](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kalimdor_(landmass) "Kalimdor (landmass)"). Knowing that the aqir would soon move to attack outlying troll territories and would simply burrow underground and establish new colonies if allowed to live, the Zandalari sent the powerful [Amani](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Amani_tribe "Amani tribe"), [Gurubashi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_tribe "Gurubashi tribe") and [Drakkari](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Drakkari_tribe "Drakkari tribe") tribes to track down and eliminate the insectoids, as well as establish new strongholds to guard the distant corners of the troll empire. The Drakkari overthrew the northern aqir, who had enslaved a group of titan-forged xref:Tolvir.adoc[tol'vir] known as [obsidian destroyers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Obsidian_destroyer "Obsidian destroyer"), while the Gurubashi succeeded in containing a group of aqir in the titan-forged prison complex of xref:AhnQiraj.adoc[Ahn'Qiraj] through a war of attrition. In the northeast, the Amani succeeded in tracking down and killing Kith'ix before establishing the city of [Zul'Aman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Aman "Zul'Aman") over its corpse.<sup id="cite_ref-Chronicle72_3-1"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-Chronicle72-3">[3]</a></sup>

During the war the aqir ravaged the jungle of [Vol'dun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vol%27dun "Vol'dun") near the Zandalar Mountains, transforming it into a desert.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

With Kith'ix dead, the trolls eventually managed to shatter Azj'Aqir. Having successfully eradicated all aqiri presence from central Kalimdor and contained the insectoids in the far northern and southern reaches of the continent, the trolls proclaimed themselves victorious.<sup id="cite_ref-Chronicle72_3-2"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-Chronicle72-3">[3]</a></sup>

### The three empires

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3b/Kalimdor_Chronicle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20180325104337)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/3b/Kalimdor_Chronicle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180325104337)

Aftermath of the aqir and troll war.

Three distinct groups of aqir managed to survive the destruction of their empire. The ones in the north congregated around the underground prison of the Old God link:YoggSaron[Yogg-Saron], evolving into the [nerubian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Nerubian "Nerubian") race and establishing the kingdom of [Azjol-Nerub](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azjol-Nerub_(kingdom) "Azjol-Nerub (kingdom)"). The ones in the southwest remained inside Ahn'Qiraj, where the energies of the Old God link:CThun[C'Thun] warped them into a race known as the [qiraji](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Qiraji "Qiraji"). During the later stages of the war, one group had also fled to the southeast. Drawn towards the lingering energies of the dead Old God link:YShaarj[Y'Shaarj], these aqir took up the name link:Games/WoW/Mantid.adoc[Mantid] and founded the colony of [Manti'vess](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Manti%27vess "Manti'vess").<sup id="cite_ref-Chronicle72_3-3"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-Chronicle72-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Battle for Azeroth

Shortly after the [Great Sundering](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Sundering "Great Sundering"), the surviving aqir known as [Zek'voz](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zek%27voz "Zek'voz") arrived on Zandalar—now turned into an island—in order to bring the newly-isolated Zandalari trolls into the service of his master link:NZoth[N'Zoth]. However, he was not prepared to encounter the titanic defenses of [Uldir](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Uldir "Uldir") and ended up being captured, studied, and finally stored in the Archives of Eternity.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

When [adventurers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") delved into Uldir in order to stop the rise of [G'huun](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/G%27huun "G'huun"), they encountered and slew Zek'voz, who summoned various Old God servants from his people's successor races.

#### Visions of N'Zoth

It was assumed that the aqir had been driven to extinction at the end of their war with the trolls, but it seems instead that they were rebuilding.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> When N'Zoth was freed from [its prison](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Prison "Last Prison"), its aqiri servants were unleashed upon Azeroth<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> under the command of the [Hivemind](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Hivemind "Hivemind").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aqir#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The insectoids are now among N'Zoth's link:Games/WoW/BlackEmpire.adoc[Black Empire] forces from the realm of [Ny'alotha](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ny%27alotha "Ny'alotha"). Aqir are unearthed in the [Assault in Uldum](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_in_Uldum "Assault in Uldum").

Aqiri are a family of  ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/3/35/Ability_hunter_beastmastery.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/16?cb=20180824001453)[\[Exotic Beasts\]](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Beasts) added in [patch 9.0.1](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_9.0.1 "Patch 9.0.1") as a replacement for the [silithid](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithid "Silithid") family. Despite the name, the only aqir who are tamable as part of this family are the large aqir goliaths. The family also includes silithid [reavers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithid_reaver "Silithid reaver"), [workers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithid_worker "Silithid worker"), and [colossi](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Silithid_colossus "Silithid colossus"), [kunchong](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kunchong "Kunchong"), and [sand reavers](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Sand_reaver "Sand reaver").

Aqir scarabs and winged aqir are tamable as part of the [beetle](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Beetle "Beetle") and [wasp](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wasp "Wasp") families, respectively.

## Trivia
