The Kor'kron Dark Shaman Armor is a Hidden Transmog Set for Shamans that is obtained from the [Kor'kron Shaman's Treasure](https://www.wowdb.com/items/105751-korkron-shamans-treasure).

## How to get the Kor'kron Dark Shaman Armor

The [Kor'kron Shaman's Treasure](https://www.wowdb.com/items/105751-korkron-shamans-treasure) drops from [Earthbreaker Haromm](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/71859-earthbreaker-haromm) and [Wavebinder Kardris](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/71858-wavebinder-kardris) in Siege of Orgrimmar on Normal, Heroic and Mythic difficulty, but you can also get it from the Black Market Auction House.

This is a personal drop for Shamans, meaning that several Shamans could get it at the same time.

That being said this transmog set has a low chance to drop and it cannot be coined by the use of a [Warforged Seal](https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/776-warforged-seal).
