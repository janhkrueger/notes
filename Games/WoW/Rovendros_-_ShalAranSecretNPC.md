# Rovendros

Rovendros is a hidden NPC found in Teloth'aran, a cave within Crimson Thicket in Suramar. After freeing him from a cocoon, he will show up in Shal'Aran, the place where our favorite Nightfallen reside.

Free him from the cocoon, and he will show his appreciation and gratitude, and then despawn.
