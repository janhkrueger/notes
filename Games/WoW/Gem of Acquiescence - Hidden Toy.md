# The Gem of Acquiescence

The Gem of Acquiescence is a Hidden Toy added in Battle for Azeroth and is found in a hidden cave beneath the Stormsong Monastery in Boralus. This toy does not appear in the Toy Box until learned and is also a part of the [Treasures of Tiragarde Sound](https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/12852-treasures-of-tiragarde-sound) achievement, listed as "Secret of the Depths".

To get the [Gem of Acquiescence](https://www.wowdb.com/items/161342-gem-of-acquiescence) hidden toy you will have to find 5 scrolls in the Stormsong Monastery, and the first thing you need to do is find an underwater cave, located by diving into a pool. You can easily find this pool near the south-western entrance to the island.

Once in the cave, you will find an Ominous Altar which you can interact with, but you can't do anything with just yet. On the floor to your left there will be a skeleton holding the first of the 5 scrolls you'll need.

The second scroll is located in a basement a bit further up north from the pool. It's guarded by a K'thir Occultist. You can easily kill this NPC, and look for the scroll on the floor.

You can find the third scroll on the main building, which has a turquoise-colored roof on the map, in the center of the island. Go upstairs and you'll find a K'thir Occultist with a scroll on the floor in front of him

The fourth scroll will be on a similar basement as the second one, on the easternmost building of the island. The scroll will also be on the floor next to another K'thir Occultist.

The fifth and last scroll will be on the floor next to a bookshelf on the open area in the middle of the island, right under the wooden planks of the northernmost part.

`/way Boralus 67.06 79.64 Damp Scroll 5 (under the wooden planks, by a bookshelf)`

After reading all 5 scrolls, you need to go back to the Ominous Altar, in the underwater cave where you found the first scroll, and interact with it. You will now be able to speak the 5 answers to it, leading to your reward: the secret toy.

## Damp Scrolls Text and Significance

After collecting all five scrolls and face the altar, a voice speaks to you. You have to recite the scrolls to it, and this is how the full conversation looks like:

This conversation is probably foreshadowing the coming of Queen Azshara of the Naga and the Old God N'zoth. There's been multiple signs of them throughout the expansion, but the scrolls and the altar specifically speak about "Her" embrace and "His" gaze, which could refer to both of them, "the drowned" which could refer to the Naga, and the "Sunken City" which could refer to the place they all live in the depths of the sea.
