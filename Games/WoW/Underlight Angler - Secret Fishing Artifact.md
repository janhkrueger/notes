The Underlight Angler is a Secret Fishing Artifact introduced in the Legion expansion. Apart from regular fishing poles which also increase the fishing skill slightly, it gives you the ability to walk on water, turn into a fish and swim faster when underwater, reduced aggro radius when fishing, teleport to nearby fishing pools and fish a whole school of fish in just one cast. Overall it is a fisherman's dream come true.
