# Farm Ethereal Weapons In Diablo 3 Season 24

## What Are Ethereal Items?

Ethereals were a primary feature of Diablo 2, but with Blizzard looking to celebrate the game and the impending release of Diablo 2: Resurrected they've cooked up something new for Dianlo 3.

In Season 24, Ethereals take a new form as a new rare and very powerful weapon of choice for your class. It's worth noting that they are only available to use in Season 24 and you won’t be able to use them with any character in after this season ends.

So why should you care? Well, according to the devs you can keep the Ethereal transmogs forever (beyond the end of Season 24) if you find ALL 21 Ethereals available in Season 24 before the season comes to a close. That's 3 each for all 7 classes available in the game. Here's what we've been told:

```
Collecting all 21 Ethereals during Season 24 will reward players with the Feat of Strength, Ethereal Recollection. Players who accomplish this will have all Ethereal transmogrify options available for future seasonal and non-seasonal play. - Blizzard.
```

This is by no means easy and if you are keen on securing that special transmog achievement you'll need an effective approach to farm all 21 fast. Hence, this guide. So read on for all the help you'll need.

## How To Get Ethereals In Diablo 3 Season 24?

First up, let's cover HOW you get ethereals in Diablo 3 Season 24. We've broken this down into bullet points so it doesn't get confusing:

* According to Blizzard, Ethereals "can only be dropped by monsters, chests, and destructibles".
* They are also account bound and that means you can't trade Ethereals from one player account to the next.
* You do not need to have a level 70 character to get ethereals to drop. In fact, there's a good reason to have a low character for farming ethereals (we'll explain that further down).
* You cannot acquire ethereals through Kanai's Cube or from Kadala.
* Based on players on the PTR, it would seem that Etherelas can drop for any class, regardless which you are using at the time.


## FOO
* Ethereal items are only here for the duration of the season. The preview blog describes them as “rare, powerful, and fleeting items.” They will not suffer from durability loss, but they also only drop during the season. When the season ends, they’re gone. However, once you collect an ethereal, it will live forever in your transmog options. (Provided you unlock them with a feat of strength.)
* Ethereals are drop-only, and they will drop at any level. This is one of the few times we can’t blame Kadala, folks. You cannot get them from Kadala or upgrades through Kanai’s Cube, so they won’t show up as part of your start-of-season process. Luckily, they’re level-agnostic — you could see one drop for your level 1 Barbarian from a random chest! But, maybe don’t hold your breath on that with the drop rate “set between Ancient and Primal items.” You’ll still need to wait for level 70 to see an Ancient version drop.
* Each class has three options, but you can only equip one at a time. Sorry, Barbarians, no dual-wielding your two one-hander options. We will see some familiar names in the Ethereal pool during Season 24: Demon Hunter’s Windforce, Witch Doctor’s The Gidbinn, and Wizard’s The Oculus are just a few examples of existing D3 legendaries that will get an Ethereal glow-up for this season.
* The power combination is entirely random. The legendary power that rolls on your Ethereal could come from any of your class’ pool of weapon legendary powers — this included class-specific off-hand options as of the PTR — and any of your class passive skills. Your Ethereal’s powers will not stack; no picking your Scythe of the Cycle in Kanai’s cube and doubling its strength with an Ethereal.
* Ethereals can only be augmented. Meaning you cannot do the following: Cube the legendary power, reforge/enchant to re-roll the item stats, trade, dye, or transmog. What drops is what you get. You can use Ramaladni’s Gift to add a gem slot.
