# Tips To Beat 7 Star Charizard Tera Raid

Over the course of this weekend, __Pokemon Scarlet And Violet__ players will be challenging their first ever 7 Star Tera Raid which features a Dragon Tera Type Charizard.

Aside from being the only way to obtain Charizard in the game currently, the 7 Star Tera Raid gives out a great deal of useful rewards such as Comet Shards, Rare Candies, and Ability Patches. This makes being able to complete the raid consistently extremely useful. Below you will find some quick tips and tricks for beating this Raid Battle, as discovered and shared by many members of the Pokemon community.

## Charizard’s Ability and Moves

* The Tera Raid Charizard has a Dragon Tera-Type, meaning that it does more damage with its Dragon moves in addition to its Fire and Flying moves.
* As a Dragon Tera-Type, it is only weak to Dragon, Ice, and Fairy type attacks.
* Charizard’s Ability is __Solar Power__, which __boosts its Special Attack stat in Sunny weather__, while also slowly draining its HP.
* Charizard will always open the raid by using __Overheat__, a powerful Fire-Type move which __deals heavy damage but lowers its Special Attack by two stages__.
* After using Overheat, Charizard will immediately __cleanse itself of all negative status conditions__, returning its Special Attack to full strength.
* Charizard’s other notable moves include the following:
  * __Dragon Pulse__ ~ A standard Dragon-type special attack
  * __Fire Blast__ ~ A standard Fire-type special attack
  * __Hurricane__ ~ A Flying-type attack that can cause Confusion, but has lower accuracy.
  * __Focus Blast__ ~ A Fighting-type attack that is powerful but has low accuracy
  * __Sunny Day__ ~ A status move that brings Sunny weather, activating Charizard’s ability
  * __Tera Blast__ ~ A powerful special attack that takes on the Dragon-type
  * __Inferno__ ~ A Fire-type attack that causes a Burn status condition, lowering the target’s physical attack and causing them damage over time.
* When Charizard reaches half-health, it will put up a __Tera Raid shield__ which makes it more resistant to attacks from non-Terastalized Pokemon, it may also heal back some HP.
* When Charizard’s Tera Raid shield is broken, it may heal back some HP and use Sunny Day, activating its ability.

## General Recommendations

* __Avoid using Pokemon with a weakness to Dragon, Fire, or Flying moves.__ Fainting in battle reduces the timer, and if it reaches zero before Charizard is defeated, everyone will fail the raid battle.
* __Avoid using Koraidon.__ Its ability Orichalcum Pulse sets up Sunny weather, which will activate Charizard’s ability and enable it to hit even harder.
* __Avoid using Rain Dance__ to remove Sunny weather. Rainy weather makes Hurricane’s hit rate 100%, which will allow Charizard to confuse your Pokemon more easily, preventing them from attacking well.
* __Use Level 100 Pokemon__ to maximize your chance of successfully completing the raid.
* __Use Vitamins to maximize your Pokemon’s key stats__ to increase your chance of successfully completing the Raid.
* __Use Cheers when necessary__
  * Go For It! ~ Boosts Attacking stats.
  * Heal Up! ~ Heals HP and cures Status conditions.
* __Use moves which reduce Charizard’s stats__
  * Reduce Def or Sp.Def to take it down faster.
  * Reduce Sp.Atk to prevent it from fainting your Pokemon.
* __Use Pokemon with Fairy Tera-Type__ to take down its Tera Shield.

# Solo Builds


## Grimmsnarl
So to explain, Assault Vest helps mitigate initial damage, and have your EV's in Attack and Sp. Def.
Focus on Spirit Break to lower Charizards Sp. Att and by the end of the sixth attack, his attacks will barely tickle. Spirit Break may need a PP boost, but it lasted me until I had 2 hits left, in which I swapped to False Surrender.
Drain Punch and Leech Life were there to help heal, however they never got use so if you prefer Play Rough then feel free to change it up.

* Ability __Pickpocket__
* Recommended Items
  * __Assault Vest__
* Recommended Moves:
  * __Drain Punch__
  * __Spirit Break__
  * __False Surrender__
  * __Leech Life__

HP 327
Attack 360
Defence 166
Speed 138
SP Def: 240
SP Atk: 178

## Flutter Mane
Ability: __Protosynthesis__
Nature: __Modest__
Tera Type: __Fairy__
Held Item: __Covert Cloak__ (purchase from Delibird Presents in Levincia city $20,000)

* Recommended EV
  * Max Sp. Atk (26 Calcium from Chansey Supply, $10,000 each)
  * Max Sp. Def (26 Zinc from Chansey Supply, $10,000 each)
* Recommended IVs
  * Max out IV's using bottlecaps
* Recommended Moves:
  * __Fake Tears__ (from TM)
  * __Moonblast__ (learned naturally)
  * __Draining Kiss__ (from TM)
  * __Calm Mind__ (from TM)

If done correctly your Flutter Mane should have 405 Sp. Atk and 369 Sp. Def. If there was an issue and this isn't exact, don't worry too much. This Fluttermane is more than powerful enough to take on Charizard and a minor difference wont change that.

### Strategy
This is super simple and __fast__. This exact attack pattern takes him out in about a third of the total time. Charizard only uses Special Attacks so regular defense is completely unnecessary. At the beginning of the fight Charizard uses Overheat then cleanses himself. __He never cleanses debuffs from himself again for the rest of the fight!__

__Calm Mind once on your first turn. After that, hit him with Fake Tears three times. If your HP falls below 130, use Draining Kiss. If not, spam Moonblast. Terastallize as soon as you can.__

__*Thats literally it*__

You may have to sneak a Draining Kiss in with the Fake Tears if Charizard targets you with the initial Overheat, which he doesn't always.

`Do I need to use Calm Mind until I'm maxed?`
__NO__. this is a vmassive waste of time__ and completely unnecessary.

Should I use Calm Mind again after Charizard cleanses my buff?
NO. Again completely unnecessary. Once you get to the point where you Terastallize, he is going to die in about 2 Moonblasts
