# Friendship Checker

## Happiness & Friendship

Friendship has been a constant feature in Pokémon since Pokémon Yellow and allows for you to create bonds with the Pokémon.

Like Pokémon Sword & Shield, you can no longer max out your Pokémon's Friendship with just the usual methods. Instead, it now caps out at 160 and can't be increased any further. In order for it to get above this level and get bonuses, you need to make sandwiches and play & wash the Pokémon in picnics.

## Friendship Checker
__Location: Cascarrafa__

In the center of the city by the fountain, you will find a woman and her Marill who will check your Pokémon's Friendship. This person will give you a phrase to denote your Pokémon's happiness. If your Pokémon is completely happy, you will be given the Best Friends Ribbon.
