# Birthday Features

## Setting Birthday
For many games, Pokémon has been doing features on your birthday. While the DS and 3DS consoles had you set your birthday into the console settings itself, this feature doesn't exist on the Nintendo Switch. Due to this, every Pokémon Center will allow for you to set your birthday. You can only set this once so make sure you get it right. This will set your birthday in the game.

When it's your birthday, there are some special elements that will happen.

## Pokémon Center Birthday
The first of which is the classic. The first time you enter a Pokémon Center on your birthday, it will be dark and a special animation of confetti will appear. The Pokémon Center Nurse will then wish you a happy birthday and a special Poké Ball cake will appear on the screen above the Pokémon Center with Drifloon and Greavard beside it.

## Destiny Mark
On your birthday, you have the ability to get a special Mark. This mark was unavailable before Scarlet & Violet ad will only appear, at rare times, on your birthday so be sure to catch as many Pokémon as you want.
