# Marks in Scarlet & Violot

## Marks on Pokémon
Marks make a return after their introduction in Pokémon Sword & Shield. These marks are like Ribbons in that they are attached to various Pokémon to show some of the unique things it has done or where it was caught.

While Pokémon Scarlet & Violet has the Ribbons which are attached when a Pokémon is caught, there are also now Marks that will be added to Pokémon as you achieve certain tasks.

In addition to that, there's a special Meal Power, the Title Power, which increases the chance of you getting a Mark on a Pokémon.

## Chances

 Rare Mark        | 1 in 1000
 Personality Mark | 1 in 100
 Weather Mark     | 1 in 50
