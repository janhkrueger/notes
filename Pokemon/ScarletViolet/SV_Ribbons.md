# Ribbons

## Ribbons on Pokémon
Ribbons make a return once again and continue .

While Pokémon Scarlet & Violet has the Ribbons which are attached when a Pokémon is caught, there are also now Ribbons that will be added to Pokémon as you achieve certain tasks throughhout the game.

Like Marks, you can have a specific Ribbon set as the main feature and with that, it will give your Pokémon a special title when it is sent into battle.
