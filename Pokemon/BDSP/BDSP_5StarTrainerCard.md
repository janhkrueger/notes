Mine 100 statues in the underground. Honestly your best bet for this challenge getting done is having Nintendo online and always going underground with the counter is at 40/40. The reason for this is because in each digging spot there’s almost a 95% chance of getting a shiny statue. Once you’ve gotten enough shiny statues just dig the normal boxes alone. This challenge took me 2 days to do. I didn’t have the National dex unlocked so I don’t know if I was limited to certain statues or not but just have it unlock just to be safe.

Win a master contest hall. So much easier compared to the OG games since it’s pretty much guitar hero. My best tips for this challenge to be done is to feed your Pokémon enough poffins for that contest stat and you’ll get it done in no time.

Get a 100 win streak at the battle frontier. It’s super easy to get this challenge done with the right mons. Here’s the video I used to get my team. (side note it shows Latias having charm but because I wasn’t able to find the move tutor to give my Latias charm I gave it a different move)

## 5th star
Complete the National dex.
