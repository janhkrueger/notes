# 5 stars

1st star: Beat the game. Nuff said

2nd star: Mine 100 statues in the underground. Honestly your best bet for this challenge getting done is having Nintendo online and always going underground with the counter is at 40/40. The reason for this is because in each digging spot there’s almost a 95% chance of getting a shiny statue. Once you’ve gotten enough shiny statues just dig the normal boxes alone. This challenge took me 2 days to do. I didn’t have the National dex unlocked so I don’t know if I was limited to certain statues or not but just have it unlock just to be safe.

3rd star: Win a master contest hall. So much easier compared to the OG games since it’s pretty much guitar hero. My best tips for this challenge to be done is to feed your Pokémon enough poffins for that contest stat and you’ll get it done in no time.

4th star: Get a 100 win streak at the battle frontier. It’s super easy to get this challenge done with the right mons. Here’s the video I used to get my team. (side note it shows Latias having charm but because I wasn’t able to find the move tutor to give my Latias charm I gave it a different move)

5th star: complete the National dex. This challenge is currently impossible since Celebi and dexoys are tied to Pokémon home and the events for darkrai and shaymin aren’t release yet. When home support is available in these games it’ll make this challenge easy for players who have gens 1-4 already done.

That’s all you 
need to know to get all 5 stars in the update games. Hope y’all find 
this guide usefully and comment some tips that you may have!
