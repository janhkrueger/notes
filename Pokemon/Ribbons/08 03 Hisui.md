**How to Obtain:**

-   Select "Prepare a Pokémon" at the Photography Studio at Jubiife Village and choose the Pokémon to get the ribbon (taking a picture is not necessary).


While this is a relatively easy to ribbon to obtain, it has the rather unusual quality of not being visible in the Generation 8 games anywhere, and will only show up when you transfer into Pokémon Home or Gen 9. For this reason you should be certain you have prepared the Pokémon for a picture before you transfer to the next generation.

(This ribbon used to be called the "Pioneer Ribbon" internally prior to Gen 9)
