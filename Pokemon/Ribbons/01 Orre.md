## National Ribbon

**How to Obtain:**

-   Purify your Shadow Pokémon at Agate Village or using the Purification Chamber (XD only).


This will likely be your first ribbon if you are using a Shadow Pokémon as your Ribbon Master, and you will need to get this ribbon before you can transfer to other games.

There are lots of methods to purify a Shadow Pokémon, but I would recommend the following:

-   If you are playing XD, just put your Pokémon in the Purification Chamber and they will eventually purify.

-   If you are playing Colosseum it's a bit harder, the best method for you will be based on your Pokémon's nature. Refer to this [Purification Guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dragonflycave.com%2Forre%2Fpurification-guide&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0g-exK-gaiQyHOBG5hgGx7) to find out what method is best for you , but I would avoid using the Battle and Call options if you plan to properly EV Train your Pokémon, as Shadow Pokémon still gain EV's through battle.


## Earth Ribbon

**How to Obtain:**

-   Win 100 consecutive battles at Mt. Battle.


You get this ribbon for all the Pokémon you bring into Mt. Battle when doing battles 1-100. This must be done without leaving the area or changing your team (swapping the order/items of your team and saving will still allow you to get the ribbon). In Colosseum this can only be done in story mode.

Mt. Battle isn't as hard as it would seem to be, in fact it is actually a great source of exp and provides coupons that can be used to get useful berries for when we get into contests (explained in [Hoenn](https://sites.google.com/view/athis-ribbon-handbook/hoenn) section).

Enemy levels range from 15-60 in Colo and 9-70 in XD, the Pokémon that you can bring are unrestricted so you can make short work of this with high level Pokémon or legendries (A big recommendation here is Kyogre, its Water Spout will often beat both the opposing Pokémon with a single move) . Even if you fail you will still be gaining useful exp and coupons to use for berries later.
