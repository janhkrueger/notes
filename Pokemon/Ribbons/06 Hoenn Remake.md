**How to Obtain:**

-   Defeat Steven at the Pokémon League.


This is the second time we are getting a ribbon for beating the Hoenn league, it should be just as easy this time.

## Contest Master Ribbons (6)

![](../pokemonimages/conteststarribbon.png)


**How to Obtain:**

-   Win master rank Pokémon contests in each of the 5 contest categories.


Once you have beaten all 5 master rank contests you will be awarded the Contest Star ribbon as a bonus. If you have unlocked a master rank contest of a category already, any Pokémon can attempt that master rank contest straight away.

Since OR/AS are remakes of gen 3, the contests have been made very similar to the original Hoenn games. Strategy is very similar to the gen 3 contests as well, but there are a few notable differences:

-   There are no limits to the amount of PokéBlocks you can feed to a Pokémon. This means its a good idea to max out all 5 contest stats before attempting the contests.

-   PokéBlocks are a lot easier to make, simply make blocks from 4 different colored berries of any type. Rainbow blocks made this way will boost all contest stats at once.

-   [Contest Combinations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FContest_combination%23Contest_Spectaculars&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1SITnqD5ldJl4kYkPwRR_Y) are back, but many of the combinations have changed. The Rest + Snore / Sleep Talk is still a great combination that most Pokémon have access to.

-   Contest Combinations give 3 hearts rather than double the hearts of the second move.


Don't forget to obtain [Scarves](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FScarf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3E84BX5tA-UcqP7vQR3SmK) to use in the contests, as usual they will help make things easier.
