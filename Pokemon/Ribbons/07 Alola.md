## Battle Royale Master Ribbon

![](../pokemonimages/battleroyalmasterribbon.png)

**How to Obtain:**

-   Win a Master Rank Battle at the Battle Royal Dome.


The battle dome is really simple, it has 4 ranks, when you beat a rank you unlock the next and can attempt that rank at any time. All you need to do is win 4 total battles (or 1 if you have master rank unlocked already)

Strategy here is pretty simple, try to survive and KO as many Pokémon as you can before any trainer loses all their Pokémon. Bringing a fast Pokémon with good type coverage is a good way to rack up KO's, and when you feel like you have a lead you can try to end the match by targeting the trainer with the least Pokémon. There will be times when the AI will gang up on you and that sucks, but you don't lose progress here so worst case you can just try again.

You can find the sets used in the Royale here:
