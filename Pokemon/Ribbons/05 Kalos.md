## Memory Ribbons (2)

![](../pokemonimages/memoryribbons.png)

**How to Obtain:**

-   Automatically obtained when transferred to Pokémon Bank with contest/battle tower ribbons from Gen 3/4.


These are the only ribbons made that do not require you to do anything to obtain them. These ribbons essentially replace all of the contest and battle tower ribbons from gen 3 and 4. Inspecting the ribbon will show a number for how many old ribbons you had in that category. If you had all of the ribbons in a category (40 for Contests and 8 for Battle Towers), the ribbon will change its color from blue to gold.

(It is worth noting that in gen 7 the color of this ribbon is bugged, and will only show blue Contest Memory and gold Battle Memory regardless of what you actually have, this is later resolved in gen 8)

## Best Friends Ribbon

![](../pokemonimages/bestfriendsribbon.png)

**How to Obtain:**

-   Talk to the NPC in Lumiose City (Prism Tower) when your lead pokemon has maxed affection hearts in [](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FPok%25C3%25A9mon-Amie&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0jToeTS1sm_ZyElPFuUD_F) Pokemon Amie.


This ribbon is very simple, just do the minigames enough so that your Pokémon reaches five affection hearts (you can see this when switching the active Amie Pokémon). The fastest way I found to do this was to:

1.  Pet the spot that gives 3 hearts(usually indicated by the Pokemon opening its mouth) until it no longer gives hearts.

2.  Feed it with any type of food until it will eat no more.

3.  Play 3 rounds of Tile Puzzle (easy mode) to fully refresh your ability to pet/eat.

4.  Repeat steps 1-3.

## Training Ribbon

**How to Obtain:**

-   Talk to the NPC in Lumiose City (North Boulevarde) when your lead Pokémon has a medal for every course in [](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FSuper_Training&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1NIM7lmPkXX2-yWTkafg8d) Super Training.


There are 30 medals in total, which you get for clearing a stage within the specified time. Each Pokémon also has a set [attack type](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FList_of_Pok%25C3%25A9mon_by_Super_Training_Energy_Shot&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1DbB34-Yxb8xFBjpbIC5w8) that is based on species, which may make this challenge easier/harder based on your Pokémon.

I can’t really give much strategy for this one, as it will mostly rely on your ability to aim at the targets. Just learn each stage and do your best to land shots while dodging attacks (don’t forget the L button gives you a shield which is very useful)



## Battle Maison Ribbons (2)

![](../pokemonimages/battlemaisonribbon-1.png)

**How to Obtain:**

-   Defeat a Battle Chatelaine at a 20 win streak on normal mode Battle Maison.

-   Defeat a Battle Chatelaine at a 50 win streak on super mode Battle Maison.


This is the first battle tower without having to attempt battles in sets of 7, you can start and stop at any time during your streak in the Maison.

(This part of the guide assumes you have read the "General Battle Tower tips" section on the [Starting Tips](https://sites.google.com/view/athis-ribbon-handbook/home/starting-tips) page)

Peoples experience of the Battle Maison tend to be pretty mixed, some find it easy after going through the difficult gen 4 towers, and others found it to be even harder. Regardless of how you difficult you find it, the strategies that you have used in prior singles towers will also work here.

That being said if you are having trouble using your current team in the Maison there is a type of team that many have had success with involving Durant.

The idea behind this is that your Durant with Truant uses Entrainment on the enemy, then you swap to a Pokémon that has Protect and a setup move. The setup Pokémon will then alternate between protecting and setting up, until they are hopefully strong enough to sweep all 3 enemy Pokémon.

While this strategy should have a high success rate it is very slow compared to battling normally, so it is up to you if you want to utilize this strategy.

You can find the sets used in the tree here:
