# Sword/Shield Raid Pikachu


My go-to Pokémon is a Tapu Fini nicknamed “Lightbreaker”.

## A breakdown:

The __Ability Misty Surge__ stops grounded Pokémon from being paralyzed.

My Tapu Fini holds a __Misty Seed__. It grants a little boost against any Pikachu that uses special moves.

The move __Magic Room__ is the main star. It removes the effects of held items —
 including __Pikachu’s Light Ball__! That should take some pressure off the 
team.


Since your Pokémon’s going first, try the move __Taunt__. It’ll __stop boosts from 
Nasty Plot or Double Team from spiraling__ out of control.

The status move __Haze__ also keeps Pikachu’s own status moves in check. Not even a huge barrier can protect from Haze.

If Tapu Fini’s not an option, a substitute can be a Galarian Weezing. Take advantage of Clear Smog to attack and remove stat changes at the same time. Instead of a Misty Seed, consider giving to Weezing an Assault Vest.
