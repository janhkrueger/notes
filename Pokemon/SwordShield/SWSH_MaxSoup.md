# Max Soup

__Location__: Master Dojo

Before Isle of Armor came out, to get a Gigantamax Pokémon you'd need to be lucky and get it in a Max Raid Battle or hope for an Event. With the Isle of Armor, that has changed due to the new feature: Max Soup

As you play through the story, you have to complete Mustard's trials and one of these is to get ingredients for Max Soup. Afterwards, you then have to go and make sure to get the ingredeints again so you can Gigantamax your Urshifu. From then on, you can use Max Soup whenever you want on Gigantamax Capable Pokémon. This means any Pokémon you encountered or bred of the following species can be made to Gigantamax. However, you need to make sure to get 3 of the necessary ingredients:

The exception to this is Urshifu which will need 3 Max Mushroom and 1 Max Honey in order to become Gigantamax.

If you use the Max Soup on a Pokémon that already have the Giganatamax Factor, then it will remove it.

# Max Mushrooms

__Location__: Brawlers' Cave, Courageous Cavern, Forest of Focus, Warm-up Tunnel

Max Mushrooms are the key ingredient in the creation of Max Soup but they are incredibly rare. To get them, there is a simple trick. You have to complete Max Raid Battles in the Isle of Armor. Once you have done so, then there's a chance of a Max Mushroom spawning in either the Brawlers' Cave, Courageous Cavern, Forest of Focus or the Warm-up Tunnel. They will also gradually naturally respawn at a slower rate

Typically, you need to do 3 Max Raid Battles for 1 Mushroom to appear, so to get enough for a soup, you'll need to do at least 9 Max Raid Battles.
