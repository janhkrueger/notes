# EV Training

Battle will reward one EV in the following stats
* Skwovet: HP
* Chewtle: attack
* Gastly: special attack
* Rolycoly: defense
* Gossifleur: special defense
* Rookidee: speed

## Vitamins raise each EV by 10
While this seems easy, vitamins are pretty expensive. They’re 10,000 Poké Dollars each and can be found in the main Pokémon Center in Wyndon. They’re also available for 2 Battle Points each in the central Hammerlocke Pokémon Center.

* HP Up: HP
* Protein: attack
* Calcium: special attack
* Iron: defense
* Zinc: special defense
* Carbos: speed


## Wings
which you can find on the ground as sparkling objects on the bridges on Route 5 and in the Motosoke Outskirts. They raise one EV each and boost the following stats:

* Health Wing: HP
* Muscle Wing: attack
* Genius Wing: special attack
* Resist Wing: defense
* Clever Wing: special defense
* Swift Wing: speed

## EV training using jobs
Once you get to Hammerlocke, you’ll unlock a new set of Poké Jobs that let you send your Pokémon off to get EV trained. The longer you send them off for, the more EVs they’ll gain.

For every hour your Pokémon is doing a job, you get 4 EVs. The game will not specifically tell you how much time you’re sending your Pokémon away, instead prompting you to send them to work for a “short” time or a “very long” time, but here’s a translation of what that all means:

* A little while: 1 hour (4 EVs)
* Very short: 2 hours (8 EVs)
* Short: 3 hours (12 EVs)
* Long: 4 hours (16 EVs)
* Very long: 8 hours (32 EVs)
* Half day: 12 hours (48 EVs)
* Whole day: 24 hours (96 EVs)



## Lowering EVs
If you accidentally raised the wrong stat and want to get rid of EVs, the only way to do this is using specific berries. Feeding your Pokémon the following berries will lower the stat’s EV by 10 and increase your Pokémon’s happiness:

* Granabeere: lowers HP
* Setangbeere : lowers attack
* Honmelbeere : lowers special attack
* Qualotbeere : lowers defense
* Labrusbeere : lowers special defense
* Tamotbeere : lowers speed


## Power items
will give eight extra EVs per event. If you do a one hour Poké Job, the Pokémon holding the item will gain 12 EVs instead of four EVs. In exchange, the power item will half your Pokémon’s speed stat while it has it equipped. The power items are also buyable for 10 BP each in Hammerlocke.

* Power Weight: HP
* Power Bracer: attack
* Power Lens: special attack
* Power Belt: defense
* Power Band: special defense
* Power Anklet: speed
