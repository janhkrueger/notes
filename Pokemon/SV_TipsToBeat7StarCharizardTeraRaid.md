# Tips To Beat 7 Star Charizard Tera Raid

Over the course of this weekend, Pokemon Scarlet And Violet players will be challenging their first ever 7 Star Tera Raid which features a Dragon Tera Type Charizard.

Aside from being the only way to obtain Charizard in the game currently, the 7 Star Tera Raid gives out a great deal of useful rewards such as Comet Shards, Rare Candies, and Ability Patches. This makes being able to complete the raid consistently extremely useful. Below you will find some quick tips and tricks for beating this Raid Battle, as discovered and shared by many members of the Pokemon community.

## Charizard’s Ability and Moves

* The Tera Raid Charizard has a Dragon Tera-Type, meaning that it does more damage with its Dragon moves in addition to its Fire and Flying moves.
* As a Dragon Tera-Type, it is only weak to Dragon, Ice, and Fairy type attacks.
* Charizard’s Ability is Solar Power, which boosts its Special Attack stat in Sunny weather, while also slowly draining its HP.
* Charizard will always open the raid by using Overheat, a powerful Fire-Type move which deals heavy damage but lowers its Special Attack by two stages.
* After using Overheat, Charizard will immediately cleanse itself of all negative status conditions, returning its Special Attack to full strength.
* Charizard’s other notable moves include the following:
  * Dragon Pulse ~ A standard Dragon-type special attack
  * Fire Blast ~ A standard Fire-type special attack
  * Hurricane ~ A Flying-type attack that can cause Confusion, but has lower accuracy.
  * Focus Blast ~ A Fighting-type attack that is powerful but has low accuracy
  * Sunny Day ~ A status move that brings Sunny weather, activating Charizard’s ability
  * Tera Blast ~ A powerful special attack that takes on the Dragon-type
  * Inferno ~ A Fire-type attack that causes a Burn status condition, lowering the target’s physical attack and causing them damage over time.
* When Charizard reaches half-health, it will put up a Tera Raid shield which makes it more resistant to attacks from non-Terastalized Pokemon, it may also heal back some HP.
* When Charizard’s Tera Raid shield is broken, it may heal back some HP and use Sunny Day, activating its ability.

## General Recommendations

* Avoid using Pokemon with a weakness to Dragon, Fire, or Flying moves. Fainting in battle reduces the timer, and if it reaches zero before Charizard is defeated, everyone will fail the raid battle.
* Avoid using Koraidon. Its ability Orichalcum Pulse sets up Sunny weather, which will activate Charizard’s ability and enable it to hit even harder.
* Avoid using Rain Dance to remove Sunny weather. Rainy weather makes Hurricane’s hit rate 100%, which will allow Charizard to confuse your Pokemon more easily, preventing them from attacking well.
* __Use Level 100 Pokemon__ to maximize your chance of successfully completing the raid.
* __Use Vitamins to maximize your Pokemon’s key stats__ to increase your chance of successfully completing the Raid.
* __Use Cheers when necessary__
  * Go For It! ~ Boosts Attacking stats.
  * Heal Up! ~ Heals HP and cures Status conditions.
* __Use moves which reduce Charizard’s stats__
  * Reduce Def or Sp.Def to take it down faster.
  * Reduce Sp.Atk to prevent it from fainting your Pokemon.
* __Use Pokemon with Fairy Tera-Type__ to take down its Tera Shield.
