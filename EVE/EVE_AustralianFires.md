# EVE: Plex 4 Good Australian Fire

*For the wall of text: sorry in advance.
But somehow I was not able to shorten it.*


For the past two decades our PLEX For GOOD events mostly reacted to incidents around the world. Beginning with 2005 and the South East Asian Tsunami, Pakistan, Nepal, japan to the fires in australia and to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund in 2020.
Today the world is still burning. COVID is still raging across the globe. This year we had so far the warmest, hottest summer in many places. (Ads for table fans in iceland!).

Part is, to my understanding, because over the last 20 years we mostly focused on helping to ease current pain but not preventing new pain.

A warming planet with more fires, more extreme weather, increasing amount of droughts is making it harder to live like we are used to. Southern madagascar is expierencing right now the consequences.
World Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley has compared the plight of the starving in Madagascar to a “horror film”, saying it was “enough to bring even the most hardened humanitarian to tears”.

With fastening deforestation these events are going to hit us at an increasing rate. The lastest IPCC report suggests we only have 5 years until 2 2 degrees celsius increase in global temperature will be unpreventable.

To tackle this, despite also trying to change our lifestyle, there are many projects which plant trees to ensure ecosystems can remain to act as a global lung and also be restored after heavy deforrestation in the past 20 years.


The TrillionTree Campain (www.plant-for-the-planet.org) can be act funding and organizing this, the planing of trees. It is tied with the Plant-for-the-Planet organisation.
A former project of the United Nations (UNEP, United Nations Enviroment Programme) it is outsorced. Formerly the 'Billion Tree Campaign', in 2011 it was handed over to the young people behind the initiative which renamed it to the 'Trillion Tree Campaign' to reflect the increasing amount if work which needs to be done to ensure a habitable planet for all of us.


PLEX For GOOD, while being so far a unique way for players to give help all over the globe, can, I think develop into a new form. Not reacting, but acting in advance. The TrillionTree Campain could be a tool for this. At least, as I think, a healthy, habitable planet will benefit us all.

Despite of just donating money, I could imagine that there could get some contests in EVE for an increased engagement and promotion.
A faction contest for trees? Who will plant more trees in a certain amount of time? Hedonist Gallente or industrial drivven Cladari?
A New Eden wide campaign? How many trees can all capsuleers plant, with the help of the SoE and Concord?
Or just a one time fund raising event like in the past.

It also offers the opportunity to get into an ongoing campaign, nothing for just short term. So despite a one time event, there can be set an goal like X amounts of trees until 2022.
Right now Salesforce has planet 12.446.113 trees, Staples Europe 1.060.892 tress. There could someday even the name CCP in the list.

Just a few thoughts because I know the EVE community can do more and most have their hearth on the right place.
